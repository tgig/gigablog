<h1>Gnotes: markdown to evernote</h1>
<p>I just pushed <a href="https://notes.giggy.com">Gnotes</a> live:</p>
<h1># Write Markdown</h1>
<p>** <strong>Save it to Dropbox</strong> **
<br/>See it in Evernote</p>
<p>As much as I looked around, I couldn’t find a simple way to <a href="https://notes.giggy.com">write markdown notes and have them saved to Evernote</a>. There is a great Sublime Text plugin, but there were some workflow issues that I didn’t like. I just wanted to write a note, save it, and have it synced to Evernote.</p>
<p>Since I couldn’t find it, I built it.</p>
<ol><li><p>I really like Evernote. But I don’t like the interface to Evernote. As a coder, I like the interface to Atom, Sublime Text, and iTerm.</p></li>
<li><p>Markdown is a beautiful thing, and I prefer to write notes with markdown formatting. Evernote doesn’t let me use markdown.</p></li>
<li><p>I like to write a lot of notes and Evernote isn’t the most convenient thing to pull up.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes I like to write very long notes and Evernote gets laggy.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t like to rely on a third party service to hold all my content, so it’s nice to have a local copy of everything.</p></li>
<li><p>And... I was curious about AWS Lambda and needed a good test project.</p></li>
</ol><p>So in my spare cycles I’ve been working on this little widget. It’s free. Give it a shot: <a href="https://notes.giggy.com">https://notes.giggy.com</a></p>
