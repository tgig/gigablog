<p>Boys,<br/><br/>Though it doesn’t seem like it when you’re young, life is short.<br/><br/>In the grand scheme of things, life is very short. A blink of the eye.<br/><br/>Don’t waste it!<br/><br/>Don’t work for somebody else unless you love it.<br/><br/>Don’t hang with people who don’t appreciate it.<br/><br/>Have fun. Laugh.<br/><br/>But do something with your time that’s worthwhile. Cause it will soon be over.</p>
