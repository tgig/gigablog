Champions aren't made in gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them: A desire, a dream, a vision. They have to have last-minute stamina, they have to be a little faster, they have to have the skill and the will. But the will must be stronger than the skill.                    <div class="caption">—  <p >- Muhammad Ali </p >
 <p >Boys, <br/> <br/>This quote is about the most important trait you can possess. It's even more important than being smart or polite or fun or good looking or educated or compassionate. It's tenacity and work ethic.  &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; The WILL to be better. <br/> <br/>Don't rely on natural skill - somebody is always more naturally skilled. Don't rely on luck - we make our own luck. Don't rely on creativity - that comes along with experience and hard work. If you have the will to work harder and longer than anybody else, no matter what you're working on, you'll be better.  </p ></div>
