<p>Dear Boys,</p>
<p>There is an old saying that goes:</p>
<h2>80% of life is just showing up</h2>
<p>Woody Allen said it, and he was talking about people who want to write a play or movie script. His point is just that, if you don’t DO the thing, you can’t accomplish the thing. He says that, of all his life lessons, this is the only one which has never failed him.</p>
<p>I find the same thing to be true in my life. But I’ll add a little color:</p>
<p><strong>Showing up is hard</strong></p>
<p>Lots of times you don’t feel like showing up. Tired. Bored. Not into it.</p>
<p>But if it’s worth showing up - if it’s in the direction of things you want to accomplish - then just do it. Even though you don’t want to :)</p>
<p><strong>You’re showing up <em>somewhere</em>, every day. Make it the right places</strong></p>
<p>One reason we moved to Silicon Valley is simply to be in the right place for what we want to do. Just by being here, we’re “showing up”. And by being here, we have the opportunity to be at the right places and meet the right people. And speaking of people -</p>
<p>When you hang out with your friends, you’re going to “show up” at whatever sort of places those people like. If you’re with good people, you’ll show up to good places, and vice versa. Another saying is that ‘you are the sum of your 5 closest friends’ - and it seems to be true – > you will show up in thought and body to the same kinds of places as your friends.</p>
<p><strong>When you show up, do it with STYLE</strong>
(hence the photos at top of page)</p>
<p>Of the 20% that remains after showing up, probably half is about making a good impression.</p>
<p><strong>Look good!</strong> You got half your Mom’s genes, so this is in the bag, as long as you put a little effort into it. Haircuts are important. Nice clothes and shoes are important.</p>
<p><strong>Smell good!</strong> Please don’t be the person who hasn’t showered or brushed their teeth :)</p>
<p><strong>Be friendly!</strong> No matter how far you get in life, please stay humble. Be friendly. (Not worried, b/c I know I’m raising friendly boys :)</p>
<p><strong>SMILE! Laugh!</strong> It’s a proven fact that people who are considered fun and funny laugh more often than others. Laugh at your own jokes. Have fun.</p>
<p><strong>To make good conversation, just be interested in other people</strong></p>
<p>If you ever feel like you don’t know what to talk about, or how to relate to people at a function, just start asking them questions. People love to talk about themselves, and if you’re truly interested in what they have to say, conversation will flow naturally.</p>
<p>That’s it. Go forth and be present! Have fun! Show up!</p>
