# How strata does not work in place of cohort

In some ways, the word "strata" is a perfect replacement for "cohort". An even better definition, actually.

The layers of a cohort can represent the layers of customers in a cohort.

But in one major way it's not a good fit. Every metaphor has a bad end, but this one might end worse and sooner than others.

A cohort represents customers who may have _first_ transacted with a company a long time ago, but the active customers in the group might still transact during a recent period.

A stratum is 1D, it only goes across. There is no second dimension.

This is a problem because a cohort is 2D and even an old "stratum" can still have very current transactions.

In geology the old strata is just old. There is no current movement, modification, renewal.

Maybe we start thinking in terms of a system. That's a topic I know a lot more about than geology.

## And, math
Strata, stratification, other derivatives of the word, have specific meanings akin to "segmentation" in math. If I used "strata" for the cohort that would majorly confuse a math person who now has to do a "segmentation" of the customer base.
