# Terminology mapping

There are lots of terms used in [[108.20 Data Analysis - Customer analysis]] and [[108.60 Data Analysis - Accounting analysis]]. There are lots of terms used in academia and by Lucky8 and Theta Equity Partners and Bain and blah blah.

We need some terms too.

This document is a running list of terms used elsewhere, originally coined and "owned" by other people, which I will re-coin and "re-own" here.

### Cohort Analysis
- Lucky8 = Level Set
- Theta Equity = C3 (Customer Cohort Chart)
    - Daniel McCarthy = C(0,0)
- Epic = Structural Analysis
- [[20200714 cohort brainstorm]]
        - Strata Chronology (not good, used too often in statistics)

### Cohort
Everybody uses the term "cohort" and "cohort triangle" and "cohort analysis". Assuming that I find a novel approach to thinking about this pattern of analysis, I could re-name and re-brand it:

- Time triangle
- Triangle retention chart: https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/retention
- Customer layer account
- Strata (not good)
- Growth Accounting (actually, this term in the overall framework by Tribe doesn't even include cohorts)

### Segmentation

- Partition
- Stratification (as used in statistics)

Relates to the concept in probability theory where a set of events should be collectively exhaustive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectively_exhaustive_events) and mutually exclusive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_exclusive_events)
