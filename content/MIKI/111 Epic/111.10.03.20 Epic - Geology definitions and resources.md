# Geology definitions and resources

**Geology** is an earth science concerned with the solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change over time.

**Stratigraphy** is a branch of geology concerned with the study of rock layers (strata) and layering (stratification). It is primarily used in the study of sedimentary and layered volcanic rocks.

**Why do we study geology?**
Because understanding the past helps us understand the present and answer important questions about the future
Geologists study rocks in order to learn more about the world around us. They shed light on some of the most important social issues in the world like sustainability, climate change, the environment. Geologists know that we need to understand the past to understand the present and make predictions about the future.

"In geology and related fields, a **stratum (plural: strata)** is a layer of sedimentary rock or soil, or igneous rock that was formed at the Earth's surface,[1] with internally consistent characteristics that distinguish it from other layers. The "stratum" is the fundamental unit in a stratigraphic column and forms the basis of the study of stratigraphy. A stratum can be seen in almost every single country in the world."
