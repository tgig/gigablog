# Timing for data analysis projects

Projects have a similar timing to them, depending on size, stage, data:

  * 1-3 weeks to get data after the [[108.10.10.20 Data Analysis - Data request]] has been sent
  * 3-5 days to ingest and map a dataset and produce the [[108.30.10 Data Analysis - Structural analysis]]
  * 2-6 weeks to analyze the data [[108.30.20 Data Analysis - Predictive analysis]], depending on how complicated the business is, and how deep the analysis is
