# Moving data from disk to S3

The first step to getting data into a Redshift database is to put the raw files on S3. From here it can be `COPY`'d onto Redshift. Getting a file onto S3 can be accomplished in a couple of different ways:

  * Use the S3 web interface (https://console.aws.amazon.com) for small files
  * Use the AWS CLI for large files. This is preferred and easier once you get it. 
      * E.g. `aws s3 cp raw_data.csv s3://bucket-name/raw_data.csv`

S3 can also act like a long term data repository. The files on local and virtual machines are subject to being deleted occasionally and S3 is a much safer place to store data.
