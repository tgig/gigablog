# Control the inputs, not the outcomes

 You don't always have control over the outcomes (the end goal that you'd like to achieve), but you always have control over what you put into something.

 Time, location, materials. Distractions or focus. 

Schedule your day. 
Buy quality. 
Pay more for location. 
Pay a fair price for a quality business.
