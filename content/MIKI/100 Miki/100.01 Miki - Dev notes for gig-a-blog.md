# Dev notes for gig-a-blog

I am creating a Github Actions workflow to automatically push this content to my blog site (https://travis.giggy.com) when I commit new files.

This file will be my test bed and running dev notes.

---

Here we go.

Changed the default `push` branch to "main".

I can see that the job is now kicking off when I push to the repo. That's a good start! Failing on line 1 though, so plenty of work left to do.

---

After many attempts, I finally have a working Github Action. Testing now.
