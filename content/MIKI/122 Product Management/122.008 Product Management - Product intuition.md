# Product intuition

A product manager should have product intuition. They must know how to take an existing product and understand how it works, what need it meets in the market, how to understand its users, and how to make it better. 
- If asked the question: "What is currently your favorite product?" and then "How would you make it better?" - you should have a structure to answer the question.
- If given a set of requirements for a product, like "how do we design a kitchen for a user who only has the use of one hand?" or "as you move your product into another country, what are some of the considerations you might have?" - you need a structure to clearly communicate.
