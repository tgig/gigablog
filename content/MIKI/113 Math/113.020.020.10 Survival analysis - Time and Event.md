# Survival Analysis - Time and Event

There are basically only two data points that are used for core survival analysis:

1. Time (t)
	- Specified in ascending numbers, from 0 to X
2. Event
	- 0 = no = censoring
	- 1 = yes

**Censoring** is when the row has a 0 for Event. Censoring can happen b/c of two different reasons:
- Right censoring = they lived longer than our observable period, but we don't know how long.
- Left censoring = they started before our observable period, but we don't know when.
