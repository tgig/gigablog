# Expected value using an insurance purchase decision

To find the expected value of a random variable like an "insurance" item:

- Phone warranty cost = 300
- Phone replacement cost = 800
- Probability of breaking phone = 20%

|                                          | Value | Probability | Value * Probability |
| ---                               | ---      | ---               | ---                           |
| Phone breaks             | 500     | 20%            | 100                          |
| Phone doesn't break | -300    | 80%            | -240                        |
|                                     |             |                     | -140                       |

In this case there is an expected value of -$140 to buy the warranty. Whether that's "worthwhile" for the consumer is a different question.
