# Prorporational Hazards (PH)

Proportional hazards are a class of [[113.020.020 Statistics - Survival Analysis]] in statistics (1). They predict the amount of time before some event occurs, like a patient dying or a customer churning. 

[[113.020.020.50.10 Proportional Hazards - Mathematical desc of Cox PH]]

## From my Two Six notes
- has a hard time fitting to yearly data
- needs a good history of data
- needs a big enough number of new customer adds (small numbers are hard)
- hard when you have a direct sales force model

### Used to predict saturation
This and other diffusion models are used to predict saturation.

### There are other growth models out there
We used PH a lot at Two Six, but we occasionally used other growth models as well.
