# The logarithm relationship to powers and squares

In math there is a beautiful relationship between powers, squares, and logarithms.

Think about the following

$$10^3 = 1,000$$
$$\sqrt[3](1,000) = 10$$
$$\log_{10}(1,000) = 3$$

It's like a triangle. You are given values on two of the points and need to figure out the third. In the first formula you are given `10` and `3` and come up with `1,000`.

Here's a great screen cap from the video source:

The `log` wants to be an exponent! It wants to be the exponent of whatever number you're trying to get the log of. E.g. `log(100) = 2` --> the log wants to be whatever exponent of `10` that equals `100`.
- IF the log is a different base, you are just trying to figure out what the exponent of the given base is in order to get the number in the parens. E.g. `log_3(9) = 2`
