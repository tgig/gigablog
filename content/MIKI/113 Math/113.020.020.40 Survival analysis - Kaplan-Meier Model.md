# Kaplan-Meier Model
aka: Product Limit Method

- Downward stepped graph from left to right
- Y-axis = Pct chance of survial
- X-axis = Time
- At `t=0` you have a 100% chance of surviving. As you increase in time you have lower probability of surviving.
- KM is non-parametric. E.g. it is a step function that steps down


This is an example of how to calculate the Kaplan-Meier:

Given the following data set:
```
Time (months)	Died (1=Yes, 0=No)
-------------   ------------------
	2					1
    3					0
    6					1
    6					1
    7					1
    10					0
    15					1
    15					1
    16					1
    27					1
    30					1
    32					1
```

For each row:
```
Time	Risk	# Died	HAZ		I-HAZ	SURV = S(t)
----	----	------	---		-----	-----------
0		12		0		0/12	12/12	1 = 100%
2		12		1		1/12	11/12	(11/12) = 0.917
6		10		2		2/10	 8/10	0.917(8/10) = 0.734
7		 8		1		 1/8	 7/8	0.734(8/10) = 0.642
15		 6		2		 2/6	 4/6	0.642(4/6) = 0.428
16		 4		1		 1/4	 3/4	0.428(3/4) = 0.321
27		 3		1		 1/3	 2/3	0.321(2/3) = 0.214
30		 2		1		 1/2	 1/2	0.214(1/2) = 0.107
32		 1		1		 1/1	 0/1	0.107(0) = 0
```

A couple of things to note about this methodology:
- The person at 3 months who was censored was simply not included - both excluded from the table, and also excluded from the hazard. 

To draw a graph for this:
- Y-axis = `S(t)`
- X-axis = Time (months)
- It manifests as a chart that starts at 100%, high on the left side, then zigs downward to the right toward 0% at the bottom right.
- Easy to see that "median survival" is 15 months - 50% of people survive past this, and 50% do not.
