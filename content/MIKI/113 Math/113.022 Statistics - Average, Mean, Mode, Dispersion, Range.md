# Average, Mean, Mode

**Average** = Mean = Central Tendency
**Median** = Middle number
**Mode** = most common number

**Interquartile range** is the amount of spread in the middle 50% of a dataset
Interquartile (IQR) range = 
- Find the median
- Find the median of the left half
- Find the median of the right half
- Subtract the smaller median from the larger medium
- That ^^ is the Interquartile range

Dispersion is the amount of spread in a dataset.
```
-10, 0, 10, 20, 30					8, 9, 10, 11, 12
```
- The dataset on the left is more disperse than the one on the right
- They have the same average (10) but get there in very different ways

**Range**
- Given a dataset, the range is simply
	- order the numbers in the dataset ascending
	- subtract the largest number from the smallest number
- Range can often tell you the difference in dispersion
