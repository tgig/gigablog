# Least Squares Method

Least Squares is the most common method to calculate a linear regression.

To calculate the equation of the **least squares** line
- Start with the usual slope equation `y = mx + b`
- Calculate the mean and standard dev of both `x` and `y`
- Calculate the `r` coefficient (get a number between -1 and 1)
- Replace the mean of `x` and `y` in the slope equation
- Calculate `m` equals `m = (StdDev(y) * r) / StdDev(x)`
- Calculate `b` equals `b = Mean(y) - (m * Mean(x))`. You now have the value of `m` so just swap that in.
- Now you can complete the initial equation with the new values for `m` and `b`
