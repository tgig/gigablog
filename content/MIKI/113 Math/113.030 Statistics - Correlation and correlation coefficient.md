# Correlation and correlation coefficient

On a scatterplot, when the `y` variable increases as the `x` variable increases we say there is a positive correlation between the variables


## `r` = Correlation coefficient
- `r` is a measurement of how close a linear line fits through points on a scatterplot.
	- "correlation coefficient is a measure of how well a line can describe the relationship between X and Y"
- `r` will _always_ be `-1 <= r >= 1` between -1 and 1
- `r = 1` - When one variable gets larger the other variable gets larger as well and you can draw a perfect line between multiple points in a scatterplot
- `r = 0` - You can't fit a line at all. It is not linear in any way
- `r < 0` when the linear line is negative
- `r > 0` when the linear line is positive
- The closer that a line can be fit directly through all points on the scatterplot, the closer it is to 1.
- The more random the dots and farther away from a line they are, the closer it is to 0
- The line _always_ goes through the mean of X and Y
- It is trying to "minimize the square of the distance between each of the points on the scatterplot"

**To calculate `r`**
$$r = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum{(\frac{(x_i - \bar{x})}{s_x})(\frac{(y_i - \bar{y})}{s_y})}$$
- Reads as: r equals 1 over n minus 1 times the sum of the z-score for each xy pair in the set
