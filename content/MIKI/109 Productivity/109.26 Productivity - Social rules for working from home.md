# Social rules for working from home

If you have to work from home, be sure that the parameters for expectations and interruptions are clarified in advance.

The family needs to know when it's OK to interrupt or ask questions.

One way I have found which works well is to let people know that if I am at my desk and have headphones on, it's probably not a good time to interrupt unless it's an emergency.
