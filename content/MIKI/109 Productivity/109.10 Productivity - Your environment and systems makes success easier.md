# Your environment and systems make success easier

Success is not the result of a strong willpower or even productivity, but rather, it is the result of having Smart systems and environments to consistently set yourself up for success.

Two days ago, 20200715, I noticed myself having problems staying focused with a weak tendency to flip to the news page of my Android phone and read articles, so I turned the content off completely. For the last 3 days, I have been mindlessly flipping to the news page, only to notice that it is blank! Then I thank myself for having the forethought to make it easier on myself to remind what is important and focus. Then I get back to working on something that is far more important.

Update from 1.5 months later. I rarely feel the need to swap to the news page anymore, the environment broke the addiction.
