# Ranga Krishnan

Ranga was a colleague at Skuchain. He is an incredible person with tremendous accomplishments. He is an MIT PhD, has 30+ patents in his name from his time at Qualcomm, created the BAFT working group at Skuchain, founded BEI.re, and has a wonderful family. I'm lucky to call him a friend.
