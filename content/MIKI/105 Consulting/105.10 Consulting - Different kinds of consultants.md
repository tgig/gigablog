# Different kinds of consultants

Consulting is much like other industries, with a few big companies and a long tail of competitors.

## The Big 4

[The Big Four are the world’s largest consulting firms, accounting for nearly 40% of the industry's $150 billion global market. PwC, Deloitte, EY and KPMG are followed by US strategy giants McKinsey & Company and The Boston Consulting Group.](https://www.consultancy.uk/news/14018/the-10-largest-consulting-firms-in-the-world).

When it comes to strategy, McK, BCG, Bain dominate the market.
