# Continual improvement and automation

Consulting can be a manual process every time, or it can slowly be automated and improved by building process, tooling, methodology. This is a business philosophy that is subjective, but in my experience, knowledge, documentation, process, tooling, made the product better and better over time.

E.g., from my time at Two Six, I took this personal note:
- The North Star is continual improvement and automation toward our goal of being far and away the best in the world at understanding and predicting future revenue. (Two Six Daily Q2 2017, 20170331)
