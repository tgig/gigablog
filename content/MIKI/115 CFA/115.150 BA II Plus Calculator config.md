# BA II Plus Calculator config
Texas Instruments calc

Entering this note just in case the calculator gets reset accidentally.

Two steps to configure the calculator for CFA:
1. Turn the number of decimal places to 9 in order to calculate more than 2 decimal places
2. Change CHN to AOS in order to avoid weird order of operations errors

See the Youtube video source for details
