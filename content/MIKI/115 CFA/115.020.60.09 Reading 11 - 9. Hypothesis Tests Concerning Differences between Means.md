# 9. Hypothesis Tests Concerning Differences between Means

## h. identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning the equality of the population means of two at least approximately normally distributed populations, based on independent random samples with 1) equal or 2) unequal assumed variances;

Skipped... this section has to do with calculating whether the means of two unrelated populations are similar to each other. The formulas are "horrific" and I'm not going to take the time to learn this specific info unless I'm looking for something to do later on in the course of studying.
