# 2. Time-Series and Cross-Sectional Data

## d. distinguish between time-series and cross-sectional data;

What is time series data?
Time series data is a set of observations collected at usually discrete and equally spaced time intervals. 

What is cross-sectional data?
Cross-sectional data are observations that come from different individuals or groups at a single point in time. If one considered the closing prices of a group of 20 different tech stocks on December 15, 1986, this would be an example of cross-sectional data.
