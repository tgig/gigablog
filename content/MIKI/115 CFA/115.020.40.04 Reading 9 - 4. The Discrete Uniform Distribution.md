What is a uniform distribution?
Uniform distribution is one which has the same probability of occurrence for all values of `X`. Also sometimes called a rectangular distribution.

What is a good example of a uniform distribution?
When flipping a coin, you have an equal chance of getting a heads or tails. When throwing a die you have an equal chance of getting 1-6. All outcomes are equally probable.

What is a discrete uniform distribution?
It is a distribution that has a finite number of possible outcomes and each outcome is equally likely. Like throwing a die.
