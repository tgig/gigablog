# Causal inference and brand impact

Quickly, b/c I'm supposed to be doing something else:

Pablo has this idea that the value of a brand can impact the CAC by 10% or the LTV by 15%, etc. If there was a way for us to quantify that the "top of mind" or "awareness" indicators could be at different levels and move those important financial metrics, that would be very interesting for companies to know.

In [[20200630 Wharton Accounting Analytics]], Chris Ittner's section on Setting Targets was relevant. Basically, said that you don't need 100% customer satisfaction in all cases - sometimes you only need 70% customer satisfaction to achieve the same thing.

And, given that I'm already interested in Causal Inference, I think there may be something interesting here.
