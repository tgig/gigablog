# Project post-mortem

A post-mortem should be conducted after the conclusion of every project. It is a meeting between all stakeholders in a project (internal for sure, but include external resources if desired).

The post-mortem should cover all the things that worked, didn't work, and what needs to be done before, or during, future projects.

Give everybody in the room the space to answer these questions.

Document everything.

Agree on a plan to move forward.
