# RFM - variations

There are some RFM variations that are useful for more specific situations

- **RFD (Recency, Frequency, Duration)** – Duration here is time spent. Particularly useful while analyzing consumer behaviour of viewership/readership/surfing oriented products.
- **RFE (Recency, Frequency, Engagement)** – Engagement can be a composite value based on time spent on page, pages per visit, bounce rate, social media engagement etc. Particularly useful for online businesses.
