# Accounting terms

### Sales vs. Revenue
`Sales <> Revenue`
- Sales is revenue generated from selling products or services to customers
- But it's not necessarily _all_ of the Revenue of a company because Revenue can be generated in other ways, specifically:
    - Non-operating revenue like income from the sale of assets, interest, royalties, etc

### Gross Sales vs. Net Sales
`Gross Sales <> Net Sales`
- Gross sales is the total amount of sales for a company
- Net sales subtracts things like returns

### Gross Profit
`Gross Profit = Net Sales - COGS`

### Gross Margin
`Gross Margin = Gross Profit / Net Sales`
`Gross Margin = (Net Sales - COGS) / Net Sales`

First calculate Gross Profit by subtracting COGS from Net Sales, then divide that number by Net Sales to get a number between 0 and 1. This percentage is the Gross Margin.

### Net Profit
Also known as
- Bottom line
- Net income
- Net earnings

A measure of profitability after all costs and taxes. This is the actual profit after deducting operating expenses that are excluded from gross profit.
