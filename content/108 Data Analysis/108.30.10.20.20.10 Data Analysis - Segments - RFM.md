# RFM = Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value

RFM is a useful model to group a customer base into segments. 

Every customer has their own pattern of transactions over time. Some transact all the time in every period, others purchase and then never come back. Recency and Frequency are the best indicators of whether a customer will transact again. (1)
- Recency = How recently did the customer last transact?
- Frequency = How many times did the customer transact in the measured periods?
- Monetary Value = How much money has this customer spent in total?

RFM is a good tool for customer segmentation (as part of the [[108.30.10 Data Analysis - Structural analysis]])

## History
RFM was originally developed in the direct marketing industry.

## Segmentation

Segmentation with RFM is created by grouping different ranges of `R` and `F+M`. One way to do it:

| Segment										| Recent Score Range	| Frequency + Monetary Score Range	|
|-------------------------------|:------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| Champions   		 					  	| 4-5 |  4-5 |
| Loyal Customers 					   	 | 2-5 | 3-5 |
| Potential Loyalist 					 	| 3-5 | 1-3 |
| Recent Customers 						| 4-5 | 0-1 |
| Promising 									| 3-4 | 0-1 |
| Customers Needing Attention 	| 2-3 | 2-3 |
| About To Sleep 							| 2-3 | 0-2 |
| At Risk 											| 0-2 | 2-5 |
| Canâ€™t Lose Them 							| 0-1 | 4-5 |
| Hibernating 									| 1-2 | 1-2 |
| Lost 												| 0-2 | 0-2 |

When mapped in a grid it looks like this:
