# Attributes of customer analysis

- **Inherently granular** - it is data about each individual distinct customer, not aggregated patterns
- **Behavioral** - don't measure demographics, look at individual behavior, actions
- **Forward-looking** - prediction, not just description. What are my customers going to do next?
- **Multi-platform** - integration of many different modes, online/offline
