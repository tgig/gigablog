# How NOT to calculate LTV

## Many companies undervalue their customer equity because they calculate LTV the wrong way
It is extremely important that LTV does not get calculated by taking an average of all customers. This is the wrong way to do it. The customer base must be segmented first. (1) [could use some more detail here]

It is now a known truth that most companies will undervalue their customer equity because they don't properly segment customers. By taking the average lifetime value across the entire customer universe they are usually getting a lower number than if they had segmented properly. (3)

Vodaphone did a segmentation of churn risk into 3 categories: Low/Medium/High churn risk, with 
- y-axis = % Customers
- x-axis = attrition percent.
