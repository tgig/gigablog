# Folders in my Zettelkasten

![[101.022-Zettelkasten-Folders.png]]

- **PROCESSED NOTES** - All the raw, source, temporary, everyday notes that I have written but no longer need front-and-center. This is the long-term repository for source material.
- **UNPROCESSED NOTES** - The notes that I take everyday. I created this folder so that a smaller number of notes can stay in front of me until they are either (a) processed into the Miki, or (b) no longer necessary. When I'm done with a note, it is moved into the PROCESSED folder.
- **miki** - The many interlinked atomic notes that make up my personal knowledge repository.
- **posts** - Blog posts, longer format, finished writing, photos, quotes, things that I want to end up on the [posts list at travis.giggy.com](https://travis.giggy.com).
- **templates** - YAML front matter templates for both mikis and posts.
