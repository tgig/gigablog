# Raw Notes

Raw notes are the most common type of note in this system. They are taken all the time every day, every time I read an article or book, watch a video, or a new idea pops into my brain. 

## The first step

They are the first step of nearly every ZK note. And the first step of creating a raw note is to add the front matter: [[101.021 Zettelkasten - YAML front matter]]

## Ephemeral

Not all Raw Notes end up in the ZK. Most of the time they are only for me, and I only move to the next step if there is some piece of information in the Raw Note that I want to save or add to the existing knowledge repository.

## File naming convention

This naming convention is uniquely mine. I doubt that it would work for anybody else.
