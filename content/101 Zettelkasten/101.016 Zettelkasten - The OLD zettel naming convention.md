## Use a nested structure
This was an old note in the version of the ZK with explicit branched naming. As of 20200824 it has been replaced with a more flexible naming convention.

---

When you create a new note it should almost always branch off an existing note.

The naming convention I have chosen uses a number starting with 101 for top-level subjects.

```
101 Index
102 Zettelkasten
103 Your environment and systems make success easier
```

Then, sub-topics below the main topic should have a sub-number. E.g.

```
102.10 Reading is for fun writing is for learning
102.20 Zettel literature notes
```

And sub-number again to make another branch

```
102.20.10 Zettel atomicity
102.20.20 Zettel note clusters
```

This naming convention is designed to group topics together so they are easy to find later.

This naming convention is based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Decimal_Classification
