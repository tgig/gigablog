# YAML front matter

The `YAML` front matter for every single note looks like this:

```
source: Source goes here
tags:
- tags are a list
relevant:
- other relevant files are a list
```

The front matter is used when the miki is published to [travis.giggy.com](travis.giggy.com). It is a major source of the interlinking that happens in-between files in the [[100 Miki]].
