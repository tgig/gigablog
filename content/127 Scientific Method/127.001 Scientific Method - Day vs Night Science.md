# Day vs Night Science

There is a time for exploration and there is a time for proof. If you confuse these two things you're likely to fail.

If you move too quickly to proving a hypothesis you are very likely to limit your potentials, limit creativity, miss opportunities in the data/problem. 

On the other hand, if you don't prove the hypotheses you find during exploratory mode, you can generate spurious relationships and false knowledge.

The two modes are complimentary, but you must know when to be one way versus the other.
