<div class="caption"><p>Dear kids,</p>
<p>When you set out to conquer the world on your own, remember:</p>
<h2>When you build products that a lot of people love to use, you can’t help but be successful.</h2>
<p>Think about that for a minute -</p>
<ul><li>You have to “build" something (which means initiative and real work)</li>
<li>You have to know what people use (an existing market)</li>
<li>You have to have a LOT of people (a big existing market)</li>
<li>You have to care deeply about the user experience, or they will never love to use your product</li>
</ul><p>You will spend a lot of time and effort (years of work) to make this happen.</p>
<p>You need skill, a thick skin, a hard head, fortitude, and some luck.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, you just need to build products that a lot of people love to use.</p> </div>
