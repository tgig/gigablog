# Never let the crowd make your decisions

Don't rely on a body of others to make decisions for you when you have the opportunity to do it yourself. William H. Seward says "history tells us that kings who call extra parliaments lose their heads." Which is to say, don't delay, don't allow "many men of many minds" to shape decisions.
