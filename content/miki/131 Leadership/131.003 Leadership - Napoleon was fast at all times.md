# Napoleon was fast at all times

Napoleon was as fast as possible at all times. He hated wasting a single minute of the day. He was constantly performing several tasks simultaneously. He prioritized ruthlessly, he didn't suffer fools (unless they were his family or friends). He even ate fast, taking only ~10 minutes for a meal.

His army was fast. His decisions were fast. He could use speed to his advantage against bigger/older enemies. One of the things that eventually contributed to his downfall was slowness of movement and decision making before/during Waterloo.
