# With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed

Lincoln: _"With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed. Consequently he who moulds public sentiment, goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions."_  

This goes deeper than public figures molding public opinion. All opinions that matter - my own family, my own company, my own self. With their opinion on my side, I can't fail. Without it, there is no hope.
