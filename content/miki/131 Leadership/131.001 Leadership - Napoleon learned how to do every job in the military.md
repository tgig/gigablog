# Napoleon learned how to do every job in the military

Napoleon learned how to do every job in the military. This was a great advantage to him as a leader because he knew when people were good/bad at their job, when they were bullshitting, how long it should take, what resources would be required, etc. He was able to parlay this knowledge into effective orders for everything including supply chains, numbers of people, organization, timing of movement, and on-and-on.
