# Allow others to think it was their idea

Eddie used to tell me that a master influencer would allow somebody else to believe that a thing was their own idea, and he was good at doing that. You could be anywhere with Eddie and he'd make you feel like the only other person in the room.

Lincoln was a master at this, too. _He chose_ Stanton for the Department of War position, and convinced 3 important (and not dumb) people that it was _their_ idea instead. This made it easy for the idea to be accepted by them and their followers.
