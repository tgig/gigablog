# "What should be done, not what can be done"

Fanny Seward was the wife of William Seward, Lincoln's Secretary of State. She was a positive disruptive force in his life, and by conduit, the history of our country. She constantly pushed him to consider what _should be done_ and not simply what _could be done_. Via her constant drumbeat of abolition, she helped her husband to feel the same way and act on first principles, morals, decency... never bending to the will of the mob.
