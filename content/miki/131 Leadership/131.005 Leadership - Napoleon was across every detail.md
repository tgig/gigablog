# Napoleon was across every detail

**Napoleon was across every single detail**. And he felt like he could impact and improve it all too.

It seemed that nothing would escape his attention. (And probably his nearly perfect memory helped.)

He had reports coming to him every day on topics ranging from the health of the army to the activity of the church, economic data, localized socialization, etc etc.

He wrote very early in his career that he felt like he could do anything the service required. Every detail was his, including things like how to make gunpowder, how to set up a supply chain. His prodigious reading gave him even the knowledge of how to set up treaties and governments.
