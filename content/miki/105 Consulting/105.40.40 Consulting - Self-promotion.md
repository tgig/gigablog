# Self-promotion

Self-promotion can happen in several forms.
- **Referrals** - this is the best
- **Articles written about you**, interviews, panels
- **Articles written by you**, published on LinkedIn, Medium, blog
- **Books written by you**

Look like the best person in the world for the type of work that you want to do for the company. _Identify who is currently the best in the world, and define a strategy on how to be considered 2X as well-known_. It might take some time, but with a little creativity, shouldn't be hard.
