There are 3 reasons that companies hire external consultants to do work for them:

1. [[105.20.10 Consulting - External data is necessary]], like benchmarking against other big players (data)
2. [[105.20.20 Consulting - Lack of in-house knowledge]]
3. [[105.20.30 Consulting - Lack of manpower and resources]]
