# Get conceptual agreement before submitting a proposal

* Before you write a proposal be sure you have conceptual agreement.
* The prospect says "these are our objectives, this is how we know we're successful, I understand how you say you can achieve those goals, and I have a sense of where your pricing is."
* You say "if I wrote this up would you be able to sign this right away?"
* If the prospect says "well, I would need to talk to my colleagues" or "the budget doesn't come through until next quarter" - then don't write the proposal up yet. Wait until you have conceptual agreement.
