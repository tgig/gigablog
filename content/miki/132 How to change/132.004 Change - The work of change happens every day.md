# The work of change happens every day

If you’re addicted to alcohol, the work of change is going one day without drinking. 

One day turns into two. 

Each day you make the choice to break the addiction, or change the habit, you’re doing the work. It won’t always be this hard, but now it is, so keep doing the work.
