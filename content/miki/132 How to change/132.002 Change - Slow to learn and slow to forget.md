# Slow to learn and slow to forget

_"I am slow to learn and slow to forget that which I have learned. My mind is like a piece of steel, very hard to scratch any thing on it and almost impossible after you get it there to rub it out."_ - Abraham Lincoln 

This may have been doubly true for Lincoln, but it is true for me as well, and I imagine true for people in general. Things are not really _learned_ quickly or easily. Real learning and change takes time, repetition, intention.
