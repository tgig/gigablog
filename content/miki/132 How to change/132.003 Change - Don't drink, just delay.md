# Don't drink, just delay

The ability to observe my own behavior in real time and make the conscious choice to delay it, can make the difference between staying on the wagon and falling off the wagon, between living up to my own ideals or failing myself.

I went through a period of time where I drank every day and I wanted to change. I learned many lessons about behavior change through that process, but one of them was that simply _delaying_ the choice to have a drink would almost always result in not thinking about it again and being successful for the day.
