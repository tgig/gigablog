# You are never free as long as you’re addicted

_“It feels like you’re free because you’re choosing, but if the answer is always yes, that’s not much of a choice.”_ - Ryan Holiday

A free brain has the choice of doing something, or not. An addicted brain defaults to the choice of the addiction. Therefore, addiction to anything is slavery to that thing, the opposite of freedom.
