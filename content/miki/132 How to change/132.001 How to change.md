# How to change

Change is hard. Countless books are written about it. 

I researched much about behavioral psychology when with [Akin](https://www.akin.com). I learned the theory of personal change, and slowly implemented much of the science into my own life.

This is intended to commit what I've learned about personal change to words and help me lock it in for myself. These things would almost certainly work for anybody, though they're not easy to implement.
