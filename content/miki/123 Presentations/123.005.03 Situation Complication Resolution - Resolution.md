# Part 3: Resolution

Part 3: **Resolution**
- How the situation was resolved
	- The role you and your team played
	- What you learned
	- Next call to action
- Tie it back to the beginning
	- Refer back to the story you started the presentation with, and people will not forget. The story is more powerful than the numbers.
