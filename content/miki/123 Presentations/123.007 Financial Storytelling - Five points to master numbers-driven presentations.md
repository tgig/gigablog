# Five points to master numbers-driven presentations

1. **Structure the presentation** properly: Situation/Complication/Resolution
2. **Love your story**. Have passion for it. If you aren't passionate about your own story nobody else will be. 
3. **Make it personal**. Use the word "I". Make sure people know you are vested in this idea.
4. **Give them context**. Mention details they have to be there with you, in the same place, and feel your story. Just don't be long winded.
5. **Keep the end in sight**. End the presentation by referring back to the story you started it with.
