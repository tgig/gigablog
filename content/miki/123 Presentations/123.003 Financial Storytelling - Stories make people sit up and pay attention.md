# Stories make people sit up and pay attention

A story helps people sit up and pay attention. It can bring numbers alive! A good story will take people's minds out of their other obligations, away from the cell phone, and put their attention temporarily on YOU.

In order to get people to pay attention to the _numbers_, it is extraordinarily effective to tell a _story_. You must have a good balance between being a good number cruncher and being a good storyteller.
