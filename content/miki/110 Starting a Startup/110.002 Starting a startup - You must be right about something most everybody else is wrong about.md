# You must be right about something most everybody else is wrong about

To run a successful tech startup you need both (a) to be right about something (b) that most everybody else is wrong about. This is because if everybody else is already right and/or agrees that they're right, then this opportunity is already exploited by somebody else. If you're a manager, especially at a big company, you don't need (b), you only need (a).
