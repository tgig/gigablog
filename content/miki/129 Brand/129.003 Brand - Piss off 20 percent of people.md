# Piss off 20% of people

In my experience with email marketing, we did best when we upset 20% of the people we were communicating to. That meant that 20% on the other side of the spectrum loved it. (The other 60% just doesn't care)

By this logic, if I want more people to love me, my company, my ideas, then I need to upset more people as well.
