# Finite vs Infinite Games

_"There are at least two kinds of games,” states James P. Carse as he begins this extraordinary book. “One could be called finite; the other infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play."_

Finite = Competition = WIN
Infinite = Cooperation = Continue to play
