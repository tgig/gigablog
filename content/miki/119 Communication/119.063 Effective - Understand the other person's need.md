# Understand the other person's needs

Everything that comes out of another person's mouth, no matter how mundane or expressive, is an expression of something they need. This universal truth will help you deepen the relationship with the and get what you want too.

They don't always know what they need when they say something - it's often subconscious.

They aren't always ingenuous with what they say - sometimes they say one thing in order to get something else.

The words are often less important than the non-verbal cues. Tone, body language, facial expressions.
