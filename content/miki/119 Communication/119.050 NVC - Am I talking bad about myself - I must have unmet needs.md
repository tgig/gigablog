# Am I talking bad about myself? I must have unmet needs!

Am I talking bad about myself? Are I self-loathing? Am I self-judging? I must have unmet needs! Discover what they are, and I'll feel better and learn something about myself. 

When I know what I need, I eliminate shame, guilt, and depression. Those feelings were given to me by nature for a reason - so that I could get motivated enough to meet my own needs. Why wait for nature to play its course when I can do it myself?
