# State observations with specific time and context

In order to communicate clearly with another person, I need to avoid having them feel judged or criticized. I must state my observations with a specific time and context. 

I will say "Drew Lock threw 4 interceptions in the last two games", and I will not say "Drew Lock is a bad quarterback." The former is fact. The latter is opinion.
