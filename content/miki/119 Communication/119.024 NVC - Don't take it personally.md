# Don't take it personally

When somebody is telling me what I am doing wrong, or stating an opinion that I don't agree with, don't take it personally. Their analysis of me (or a situation) is an expression of their own needs and values. Often it has nothing to do with _me_, and everything to do with _them_.

And the same is true in reverse. When I am annoyed or upset at somebody else, or a situation, this is usually not about _them_. It is usually about _me_, and what feeling or need that I'm not receiving. It's time to intercept the harsh words about to come out of my mouth and talk about my needs instead.
