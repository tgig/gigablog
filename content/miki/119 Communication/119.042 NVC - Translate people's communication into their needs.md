# Translate people's communication into their needs

The first skill to learn for nonviolent communication is to translate people's communication, whatever form it may be in, into their needs. They might be talking, or being silent. They might be in denial, judging somebody, using body language. My communication skill relies on hearing the need in every message, even if at first it is just a guess.

This is the challenge and the opportunity: To recognize the need where no need was actually expressed. It takes presence and practice, but when the need is understood it creates a connection.
