# State your needs

How could I possibly expect my needs to be met if I don't express them clearly and without implying guilt to the person who can help? Why would I ever expect another person to (or to be able to) guess my needs perfectly and fulfill them? Ludicrous!

If I don't value my own needs, why would anybody else? If I'm constantly submitting to other's needs and subsuming my own, why does anybody else need to acknowledge mine? Life is a two-way street, and I'll best serve those in my life when I feel heard, acknowledged, and understood by them as well.
