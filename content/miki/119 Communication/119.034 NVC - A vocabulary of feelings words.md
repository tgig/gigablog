# Develop a vocabulary of "feelings" words

It is important to develop a vocabulary of "feelings" words and be able to associate them with a specific moment in time. My first thought of doing this was an uncomfortable one, because I never learned how to associate my feelings with words, and because it's not particularly "manly" to consider feelings. Once I realized how much of my life outcomes were not under my control, and how much pain and frustration I was causing others because I was reacting blindly to feelings, the logical argument outweighed the cultural embedding, and I began to learn how to put words to my feelings.
