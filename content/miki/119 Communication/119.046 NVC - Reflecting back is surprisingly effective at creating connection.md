# Reflecting back what somebody said to me is surprisingly effective at creating connection

It amazes me when I reflect back the emotion and content of somebody who is having a hard time, and they look at me like: "Yes. You get it. That's exactly what I'm feeling and what I'm trying to say." It's a wonderful feeling, a connection, an experience that I would not have otherwise had.
