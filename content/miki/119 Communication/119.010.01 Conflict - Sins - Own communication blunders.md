# Own communication blunders

It is important to be able to identify these troublesome areas and stop them, right away. 

If you're talking and notice yourself commit a sin, then own it, admit it, and try again. 

If you catch the other person doing it, and they don't own it, then you _must_ call it out right away, you can't let the other person get away with it because it often causes a conversation to devolve into an argument. "Try again", "Please say that more gently", "That felt like an insult", "Let's start over", "Let's take a ten minute break", "Let's calm down", your "safe word".
