# Avoid criticizing by separating observation and evaluation

Always cleanly separate observations and evaluations. For myself, and in communication with others, `observation + evaluation = criticism`, and they will resist whatever I have to say next, despite it's intention or wisdom. In return, people often respond with self-defense or counterattack.

In other words: Observe and reflect, but don't give an opinion until the appropriate time.
