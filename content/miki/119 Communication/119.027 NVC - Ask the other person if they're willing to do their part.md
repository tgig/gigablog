# Ask the other person if they're willing to do their part

Do not demand anything of anybody. Instead, ask them if they're willing to do their part. This gets to the bottom of the situation - the other person is willing to accommodate my needs or they're not. 
- If they want to do this, we move closer together and they do the thing with their own motivation. 
- If they don't want to do this, then we can have an empathetic discussion about how get their needs met, or part ways amicably.
