# It is difficult for me to put a descriptive word to feelings

It is difficult for me to give my feelings a descriptive word. It is even more difficult for me to describe how another person may be feeling. I did not grow up with "feeling" words, I never had to learn the skill in my professional career, and society discourages males from even wanting to understand feelings. This blind spot has kept me from connecting with people my entire life. It prevents from me really being connected to, or understanding, anybody except those who I've been in the trenches with that I have shared understanding about a specific topic.
