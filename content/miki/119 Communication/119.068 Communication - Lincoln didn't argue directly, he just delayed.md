# Lincoln didn't argue directly, he just delayed

Lincoln never argued directly with his wife. He would lose himself in thought, find himself busy with something, go to the library (occasionally staying the whole night) until the storm had passed.

It was not dissimilar with his colleagues. He would very very rarely have a direct conflict with them, despite many good reasons to do so.

I don't know if this is something good to adopt, much of the other learnings I've received are about direct-yet-empathetic communication... but given that he was one of the best communicators of all time, it seems worth thinking about.
