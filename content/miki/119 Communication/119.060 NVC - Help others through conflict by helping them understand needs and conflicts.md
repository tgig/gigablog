# Help others through conflict by helping them understand needs and resources

Helping others through conflict can be as easy as listening for needs and laying it out like 
- "Here are the needs of both sides. 
- Here are the resources. 
- What can be done to meet these needs?"

When everybody has come to clear, present, positive action language on next steps, the conflict can be moved toward resolution.
