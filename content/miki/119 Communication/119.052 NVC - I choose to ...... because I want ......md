# I choose to ..... because I want .....

Is there something dreaded and terrible that I dislike doing? Stop doing it!

But what if I _must_ do that thing? 

Find a way to change the narrative from _"I have to"_ to _"I choose to"_! Take command of yourself, have integrity, have a spine, and do something because you choose to do it. Or don't do it.

_"I choose to ....... because I want ....... "_ and discover the why:
- Maybe I value the money it provides more than I hate doing it? 
- Maybe I seek the approval of somebody else? 
- Maybe I want to escape punishment?
- Maybe I want to avoid shame or guilt?
- Maybe I have a sense of duty?  

It is truly worth examining the reason for doing anything we dislike. If, after examination, there is truly nothing good about it, then stop doing it.
