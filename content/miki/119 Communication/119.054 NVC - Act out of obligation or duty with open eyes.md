# Are you acting out of a sense of obligation or duty? Do it with open eyes.

When I examine the "why" behind my actions, and I discover that I'm doing something I dislike out of a sense of duty or obligation, it's time to raise the alarm. 

Am I at choice in this? 

What is the consequence of not doing it? 

Doing anything because _"I'm supposed to"_ or to [[119.053 NVC - Escape shame and guilt with open eyes|avoid guilt and/or shame]] might mean that I'm not valuing my own needs. Is somebody else's well-being worth the subjugation of my own?
