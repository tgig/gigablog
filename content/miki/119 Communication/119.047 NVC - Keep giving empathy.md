# Keep giving empathy

In an emotionally charged conversation, keep giving empathy, keep repeating the feelings and content in the form of questions and empathetic statements, until hearing a release of tension or a pause from the other person.

Stay with empathy. Allow the other person to fully express themselves. Only then is it time to talk about solutions or personal requests.
