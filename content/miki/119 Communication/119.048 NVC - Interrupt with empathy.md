# Need to interrupt somebody? Interrupt with empathy

If you're shut out of a conversation, if somebody is talking too much, rambling on, or raging away, it is OK to interrupt and get it on a mutual track. 

**Interrupt with empathy!** 

_"I'm feeling impatient because I'd like to understand what you're trying to say and I'm having a hard time with it. I'd like to know if you can communicate what you need right now."_ 

Most people actually prefer to be interrupted politely rather than somebody pretending to listen to them.
