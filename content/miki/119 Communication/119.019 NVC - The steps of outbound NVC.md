# The steps of outbound NVC

- **Observation**: Say what is happening without judgment or evaluation - just say the physical manifestation of what is happening and don't characterize it as good or bad.
- **Feeling**: State how I feel when this happens. Put a word to the feeling - am I hurt, scared, happy, amused, annoyed?
- **Need**: Acknowledge the root of this feeling with "because" followed by the reason you're feeling this way and clearly say what need I have that is connected to the feeling I have identified.
- **Request**: Ask the other person if they're willing to help you fulfill your need
