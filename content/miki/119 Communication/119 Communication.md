# Communication

## Constructive Conflict

There is much to learn in this life about communication. For me in the past, conflict was something to be avoided. But with communication comes conflict. And when done right, communication (and subsequent constructive conflict) can be productive, exploratory, and interesting.

[[119.003 Conflict - Are you there for me]]
[[119.004 Conflict - Choose the right time and place for a difficult conversation]]
[[119.005 Conflict - How to start difficult conversations]]
[[119.006 Conflict - Is this fight about what you think it's about]]
[[119.007 Conflict - Know what question you want answered]]
[[119.008 Conflict - Paraphrase the other person in order to have an efficient conversation]]
[[119.009 Conflict - Acknowledge feelings]]
[[119.010 Conflict - The 4 sins of conflict]]

[[119.012 Conflict - Know when to JUST STOP]]
[[119.013 Conflict - What's behind the impasse]]
[[119.014 Conflict - Memorialize your agreements]]

Notes: This is a book I picked up because I promised Monique that I would try to find something effective at helping us work through difficult conversations, to lock in and supplement the time we've spent with Michele.

## Nonviolent communication

This book by Marshall B Rosenberg has been life changing for me. I have become a much better listener, I can resolve conflict faster, I feel more connected to people around me. 

I am far from mastering the art of NVC. It is simple on the surface, but mastery means understanding people and their motivations at a deeper level than I am currently capable of.
