# "Should" and "Have to" will not be in my vocabulary

The words "should" and "have to" imply that something is wrong or that blame is deserved. These words are moral judgments! Whether applied to myself or toward others, these words subtly cause us to defer to outside authorities for what is right/wrong/good/bad. Why would I give up my own understanding of what is good!? I am not a slave, I am not subjugated, and I have no desire to put that on other people either.
