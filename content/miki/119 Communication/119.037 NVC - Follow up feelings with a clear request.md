# Follow up feelings with a clear request

Always follow up a statement of personal feelings with a clear request of what I need. If I only state my "feelings", the other person must guess what I want them to do about it.

Be specific when making a request. The more specific I can be, the more likely I will get what I seek. Instead of saying "What do you think about that?", say "What do you think my proposal's chance of success is? And if it's low, what do you think would prevent its success?"
