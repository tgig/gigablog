# How NVC connects to my life mission

My mission to become a world-class communicator begins with the ability to express myself with honesty and clarity, and hear what others are saying with empathy and focused attention. 

NVC will help me stay in better touch with myself, create greater depth in my personal relationships, and build effective relationships at work.
