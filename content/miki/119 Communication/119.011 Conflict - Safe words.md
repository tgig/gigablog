# Safe words

A safe word or phrase can be a good idea to interrupt a conversation that's going badly and let the other person know that it's time for everybody to take a step back, calm down, re-phrase, or try again. This is a good strategy for calling out any of the 4 sins, and works especially well to avoid stonewalling.
