# "Judging" somebody is violence toward them

Judging somebody else is violence. 

Sometimes I use judgments to try and get somebody to do something. When I'm successful, I feel like I can frighten them, punish them, guilt them, to change behavior. I believe that it's possible to change them through violence. This is not real change, it will revert as soon as I'm not around, and I would never want somebody to do this to me. 

It also creates a self-fulfilling prophecy because I am already biased to see them in a certain way.
