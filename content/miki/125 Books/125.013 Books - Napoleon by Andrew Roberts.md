# Napoleon

I am re-reading a biography of Napoleon and highlighting many of the passages related to his life lessons and personality.

## Impressions

Several notes were pulled from the highlights below, written in my own words, and sprinkled throughout the miki. Each one links back to this page.


## Notes and highlights

## Introduction

### Highlight (yellow) - Page xxviii · Location 456

Napoleon was able to compartmentalize his life to quite a remarkable degree, much more so even than most statesmen and great leaders. He could entirely close off one part of his mind to what was going on in the rest of it; he himself likened it to being able to open and close drawers in a cupboard.

### Highlight (yellow) - Page xxviii · Location 508

It was thus Colbertian protectionism that brought him down, far more than the bloodlust and egomania of which he is so often accused.

### Highlight (yellow) - Page xxviii · Location 521

He convinced his followers they were taking part in an adventure, a pageant, an experiment and a story whose sheer splendour would draw the attention of posterity for centuries. He was able to impart to ordinary people the sense that their lives — and, if necessary, their deaths in battle — mattered in the context of great events. They too could make history.

### Highlight (yellow) - Page xxviii · Location 547

Although he was often self-deprecating in private and admitted the mistakes that led to his myriad disasters to his friends and secretaries, he chose not to do so in his memoirs. As politicians tend to, he exaggerated his achievements and underplayed defeats.

## Part One: RISE

### Highlight (yellow) - 1: Corsica > Page 12 · Location 848

A powerful theme thus emerges from Napoleon’s adolescent reading. While his contemporaries played sports outside, he would read everything he could about the most ambitious leaders of the ancient world.

### Highlight (yellow) - 1: Corsica > Page 17 · Location 939

(Defeat had been, as it is so often in history, the mother of reform.)

### Highlight (yellow) - 1: Corsica > Page 25 · Location 1122

‘ There is nothing in the military profession I cannot do for myself, ’ Napoleon was to boast. ‘ If there is no-one to make gunpowder, I know how to make it; gun carriages, I know how to construct them; if it is founding a cannon, I know that; or if the details of tactics must be taught, I can teach them. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 2: Revolution > Page 38 · Location 1367

So he left for Paris.

### Highlight (yellow) - 2: Revolution > Page 40 · Location 1406

‘ Che coglione! ’ (‘ What asses! ’) he exclaimed in Italian when, from an upstairs window, he saw the Swiss Guards refrain from firing on the mob, at what turned out to be the cost of their lives.

### Highlight (yellow) - 3: Desire > Page 66 · Location 1941

‘ Good and upstanding people must be persuaded by gentle means, ’ Napoleon would later write. ‘ The rabble must be moved by terror. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 3: Desire > Page 66 · Location 1946

‘ If you treat the mob with kindness, ’ he told Joseph later, ‘ these creatures fancy themselves invulnerable; if you hang a few, they get tired of the game, and become as submissive and humble as they ought to be. ’ 50

### Highlight (yellow) - 3: Desire > Page 71 · Location 2066

As a wedding gift, Napoleon gave her a gold enamelled medallion engraved with the words ‘ To Destiny ’. 72

### Highlight (yellow) - 3: Desire > Page 72 · Location 2086

But what struck me still more was the sight of a commander-in-chief perfectly indifferent about showing his subordinates how completely ignorant he was of various points of a business which the youngest of them was supposed to know perfectly, and this raised him a thousand cubits in my opinion.

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 74 · Location 2102

‘ A general’s most important talent is to know the mind of the soldier and gain his confidence ,

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 81 · Location 2196

His special ability, amounting to something approaching genius, was to translate the sketchiest of general commands into precise written orders for every demi-brigade.

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 82 · Location 2216

a strategy to which he would adhere throughout his career. ‘ It is contrary to all principle to make corps which have no communication act separately against a central force whose communications are open ’, was one of his maxims of war.

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 83 · Location 2249

Several of his future battles were to follow the same parameters : an elderly opponent lacking energy; a nationally and linguistically diverse enemy confronting the homogeneous French army; a vulnerable spot which he would latch on to and not let go. The French had moved significantly faster than their enemy, and he had employed a concentration of forces that reversed the numerical odds for just long enough to be decisive.

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 83 · Location 2252

Another recurring feature was the fast follow-up after victory : the day after Montenotte, Napoleon fought another engagement at Millesimo, a hamlet on the River Bormida ,

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 85 · Location 2284

He encouraged everything that permitted faster movement ,

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 91 · Location 2413

Vaunting ambition can be a terrible thing, but if allied to great ability – a protean energy, grand purpose, the gift of oratory, near-perfect recall, superb timing, inspiring leadership – it can bring about extraordinary outcomes.

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 92 · Location 2421

The systematic exaggeration of enemy losses and diminution of his own was to be a persistent feature throughout all Napoleon’s campaigns, and had of course been a feature of the writings of the classical authors with whom he was so familiar.

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 92 · Location 2428

disinformation has been an acknowledged weapon of war since the days of Sun-tzu. (Winston Churchill once observed that in wartime, truth is so precious that she needs to be defended by a bodyguard of lies.)

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 92 · Location 2432

throughout his career he displayed an extraordinary ability to present terrible news as merely bad, bad news as unwelcome but acceptable, acceptable news as good, and good news as a triumph.

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 93 · Location 2460

Ever since General Dumouriez’s treason in 1793, no government had wanted to accord too much power to any one general.

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 97 · Location 2529

For Napoleon to convince Europe of the essential superiority of the French model of government, he would need active collaboration and not mere submission. He could win the war, but his administrators would have to move in swiftly afterwards to win the peace.

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 99 · Location 2571

‘ If you make war, ’ he would say to General d’Hédouville in December 1799, ‘ wage it with energy and severity; it is the only means of making it shorter and consequently less deplorable for mankind. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 101 · Location 2619

He had already assumed his own place, and set others at a distance. ’ This was deliberate; even at twenty-seven Napoleon was beginning to use his aides-de-camp, secretaries and domestic staff to regulate his accessibility and enhance his status.

### Highlight (yellow) - 4: Italy > Page 104 · Location 2680

Napoleon was capable of compartmentalizing his life, so that one set of concerns never spilled over into another – probably a necessary attribute for any great statesman, but one he possessed to an extraordinary degree. ‘ Different subjects and different affairs are arranged in my head as in a cupboard, ’ he once said. ‘ When I wish to interrupt one train of thought, I shut that drawer and open another. Do I wish to sleep? I simply close all the drawers, and there I am – asleep. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 5: Victory > Page 105 · Location 2690

‘ In order to lead an army you have ceaselessly to attend to it, be ahead of the news, provide for everything. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 5: Victory > Page 105 · Location 2693

‘ There is but one step from triumph to downfall. I have seen, in the most significant of circumstances, that some little thing always decides great events. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 5: Victory > Page 115 · Location 2915

That night Napoleon slept with Augereau’s division, wrapped in his cloak under the stars and sharing their rations, as he often did in his early campaigns

### Highlight (yellow) - 5: Victory > Page 131 · Location 3238

In all, 141 different official medals were struck by 1815 commemorating battles, treaties, coronations, river crossings, his marriage and entries into foreign capitals, and were distributed widely to the crowds at official events and celebrations.

### Highlight (yellow) - 5: Victory > Page 133 · Location 3281

His leadership qualities – acting with harshness when he thought it deserved, but bestowing high praise on other occasions – produced the esprit de corps so necessary to victory. ‘ In war, ’ he was to say in 1808, ‘ moral factors account for three-quarters of the whole; relative material strength accounts for only one-quarter. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 5: Victory > Page 134 · Location 3295

He believed above all in the maintenance of strong esprit de corps. Although this combination of spirit and pride is by its nature intangible, he knew an army that had it could achieve wonders.

### Highlight (yellow) - 5: Victory > Page 134 · Location 3296

‘ Remember it takes ten campaigns to create esprit de corps, ’ he was to tell Joseph in 1807, ‘ which can be destroyed in an instant. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 5: Victory > Page 134 · Location 3310

Napoleon ‘ heard, interrogated, and decided at once; if it was a refusal, the reasons were explained in a manner which softened the disappointment ’.

### Highlight (yellow) - 5: Victory > Page 135 · Location 3324

His constant references to the ancient world had the intended effect of giving ordinary soldiers a sense that their lives – and, should it come to that, their deaths in battle – mattered, that they were an integral part of a larger whole that would resonate through French history.

### Highlight (yellow) - 5: Victory > Page 135 · Location 3326

Napoleon taught ordinary people that they could make history, and convinced his followers they were taking part in an adventure, a pageant, an experiment, an epic whose splendour would draw the attention of posterity for centuries to come.

### Highlight (yellow) - 5: Victory > Page 136 · Location 3338

Napoleon learned many essential leadership lessons from Julius Caesar, especially his practice of admonishing troops he considered to have fallen below expectations ,

### Highlight (yellow) - 5: Victory > Page 136 · Location 3355

‘ Severe to the officers, ’ was his stated mantra, ‘ kindly to the men. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 6: Peace > Page 154 · Location 3655

Napoleon understood the power that spectacle held over the public imagination, and wanted the new French Republic to make the same visual impact that the old European monarchies enjoyed.

### Highlight (yellow) - 6: Peace > Page 156 · Location 3717

he was elected a member of the Institut de France, then (as now) the foremost intellectual society in France ,

### Highlight (yellow) - 6: Peace > Page 157 · Location 3721

Napoleon said : ‘ The true conquests, the only ones that cause no regret, are those made over ignorance. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 6: Peace > Page 157 · Location 3723

‘ I well knew that there was not a drummer in the army but would respect me the more for believing me to be not a mere soldier, ’ he said.

### Highlight (yellow) - 6: Peace > Page 157 · Location 3742

she asked Napoleon : ‘ Whom do you consider the best kind of woman? ’ clearly expecting a compliment of some kind to her own famed intelligence and writing ability, whereupon Napoleon answered : ‘ She who has had the most children. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 6: Peace > Page 158 · Location 3748

When Tone had told him he wasn’t a military man and couldn’t be of much use, Napoleon had interrupted him : ‘ But you’re brave. ’ Tone modestly agreed that he was indeed. ‘ Eh bien, ’ said Napoleon, according to Tone’s later account, ‘ that will suffice. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 6: Peace > Page 158 · Location 3750

Napoleon visited Boulogne, Dunkirk, Calais, Ostend, Brussels and Douai over two weeks in February to evaluate the chances of a successful invasion, interviewing sailors, pilots, smugglers and fishermen, sometimes until midnight. ‘ It’s too hazardous, ’ he concluded. ‘ I will not attempt it. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 7: Egypt > Page 164 · Location 3874

‘ Savants and intellectuals are like coquettes, ’ Napoleon was later to tell Joseph; ‘ one may see them and talk with them, but don’t make one your wife or your minister. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 7: Egypt > Page 166 · Location 3887

Napoleon prepared for the first French military action in the Middle East since the Crusades with his usual mastery of minutiae.

### Highlight (yellow) - 7: Egypt > Page 167 · Location 3910

He pronounced that novels were ‘ for ladies ’ maids ’ and ordered the librarian, ‘ Only give them history books. Men should read nothing else. ’ 17 He was apparently overlooking the forty novels, including English ones in French translation, he himself had brought out.

### Highlight (yellow) - 7: Egypt > Page 169 · Location 3955

Napoleon was not afraid to invoke the deity – even to appear to take the side of the Muslims against the Pope – if it would serve his purpose and win over the population.

### Highlight (yellow) - 7: Egypt > Page 174 · Location 4064

Asked two decades later whether he had ever truly embraced Islam, Napoleon laughingly replied : ‘ Fighting is a soldier’s religion; I never changed that. The other is the affair of women and priests. As for me, I always adopt the religion of the country I am in. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 7: Egypt > Page 174 · Location 4066

Napoleon respected Islam, regarding the Koran as ‘ not just religious; it is civil and political. The Bible only preaches morals. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 7: Egypt > Page 178 · Location 4162

But he refused to accept what he called ‘ this reverse ’ as evidence that Fortune had forsaken him. ‘ She has not abandoned us yet, far from it, ’ he told the Directory, ‘ she has served us during this entire operation beyond anything she has ever done. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 7: Egypt > Page 182 · Location 4234

At the time he ordered that all rebels captured under arms should be beheaded and their corpses thrown into the Nile, where they would float past and terrorize the rest of the population; their heads were put in sacks, loaded on mules and dumped in piles in Ezbekyeh Square in central Cairo. 86 ‘ I cannot describe the horror, ’ recalled an eyewitness, ‘ but I must confess that it had the effect for a considerable time of securing tranquillity

### Highlight (yellow) - 8: Acre > Page 191 · Location 4412

As his remarks on the September Massacres in Paris and his actions in Binasco, Verona and Cairo demonstrated, Napoleon approved of uncompromising – indeed lethal – measures if he felt the situation demanded them.

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 206 · Location 4713

‘ I returned to France at a fortunate moment, when the existing government was so bad it could not continue. I became its chief; everything else followed of course – there’s my story in a few words. ’ Napoleon on St Helena

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 206 · Location 4716

‘ The men who have changed the world never succeeded by winning over the powerful, but always by stirring the masses. The first method is a resort to intrigue and only brings limited results. The latter is the course of genius and changes the face of the world. ’ Napoleon on St Helena

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 207 · Location 4733

It was Charles who finally rejected the bereft Josephine romantically, whereupon the dapper boulevardier-hussar strolled off the pages of history. When Napoleon came to absolute power very shortly afterwards, he made no attempt to pursue or punish him.

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 208 · Location 4750

Whichever was the true explanation, or combination of them, he forgave Josephine totally, and never made allusion to her infidelity again, either to her or to anyone else.

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 208 · Location 4761

If the Directors ever seriously considered a suggestion from Bernadotte that he be court-martialled, they quickly dropped it after hearing their own guard break out into spontaneous cheers of ‘ Vive Bonaparte! ’ once he was recognized outside their council chamber.

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 210 · Location 4798

For a man who wrote an average of fifteen letters a day, this time everything was to be done by word of mouth. He had already once in his life had his correspondence ransacked for evidence with which to guillotine him, and he wasn’t going to allow it to happen again.

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 212 · Location 4835

Few blights undermine a society more comprehensively than hyperinflation, and great political prizes would go to anyone who could defeat it. (The deputies of the legislature paid themselves in an inflation-proof way, by index-linking their salaries to the value of 30,000 kg of wheat.)

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 213 · Location 4859

But ‘ When the house is crumbling, is it the time to busy oneself in the garden? ’ Napoleon asked Marmont rhetorically. ‘ A change here is indispensable. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 213 · Location 4863

‘ A nation is always what you have the wit to make it, ’ he said. ‘ The triumph of faction, parties, divisions, is the fault of those in authority only. No people are bad under a good government, just as no troops are bad under good generals. These men are bringing France down to the level of their own blundering. They are degrading her, and she is beginning to repudiate them. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 213 · Location 4868

‘ There’s no-one more pusillanimous than me when I make a military plan, ’ Napoleon told Roederer on the 27th. ‘ I exaggerate all the possible dangers and all the possible harms in the circumstances. I get in a very tiresome agitation. This doesn’t prevent me looking very serene in front of those surrounding me. I’m like a woman who’s giving birth. And when I’m resolved, everything is forgotten except what can make it succeed. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 215 · Location 4906

It was welcome news for Napoleon that Fouché was supporting the coup, since he was never found on the losing side (although he also had contingency plans to arrest the ‘ rebels ’ should the attempt fail. 34)

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 216 · Location 4932

‘ The former made sure never to rush or contradict this impetuous character. That would have been to push him to ever-greater fury; but he let him get on with his rage; he gave him time to dictate the most iniquitous edicts, and waited with wisdom and patience for the moment when this fit of anger had finally blown over to make some observations to him. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 218 · Location 4980

It was a smart move to suggest that he was in fact protecting the chambers even while he was in the very process of abolishing them.

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 218 · Location 4987

Those members of the Elders likely to oppose the decree simply weren’t given proper notice of the extraordinary (and extraordinarily early) meeting, one of the oldest tricks in politics.

### Highlight (yellow) - 9: Brumaire > Page 227 · Location 5170

Army officers prize order, discipline and efficiency, each of which Napoleon considered by then to be more important than liberty, equality and fraternity ,

## Part Two: MASTERY

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 231 · Location 5196

He later wrote of Sieyès, ‘ He was not a man of action : knowing little of men’s natures, he did not know how to make them act. His studies having always led him down the path of metaphysics. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 232 · Location 5205

The day after the coup the city was already placarded with Napoleon’s version of events – ‘ twenty assassins threw themselves upon me and aimed at my chest ’ – and his call for national unity. The narrative mentioned neither Sieyès nor Ducos.

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 232 · Location 5209

Although Napoleon’s propagandists had been up all night printing the posters and plastering them around Paris, Sieyès and his supporters weren’t so energetic.

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 233 · Location 5240

‘ A newly born government must dazzle and astonish, ’ he told Bourrienne at this time. ‘ When it ceases to do that it fails. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 234 · Location 5250

Napoleon quickly established a central system for the payment of the army, hitherto done through the departments, a classic example of how he was able to slice through bureaucracy and implement a much-needed reform without delay.

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 234 · Location 5259

As he was to write of Julius Caesar, ‘ In such a state of affairs these deliberative assemblies could no longer govern; the person of Caesar was therefore the guarantee of the supremacy of Rome in the universe, and of the security of citizens of all parties. His authority was therefore legitimate. ’ 17 His attitude to the government of France in 1799 was identical.

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 236 · Location 5329

When the mayor of Lille expressed reservations about welcoming a former Jacobin general to his city, Napoleon retorted : ‘ Do not dare to say anything of the kind; do you not see that now we are all equally serving France? I would have you know, sir, that between 17 and 18 Brumaire I have erected a wall of brass which no glance may penetrate, and against which all recollections must be dashed to pieces! ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 238 · Location 5335

Napoleon’s brass-wall policy allowed him to rally a very wide spectrum of opinion to his government, spanning every faction except the neo-Jacobins.

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 238 · Location 5337

The process of national unification regardless of previous political stances was called ralliement – literally, winning over – and although some joined the Napoleonic regime out of self-interest, many did it out of genuine patriotism, once they saw how Napoleon was regenerating France.

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 238 · Location 5340

A second, related policy, called amalgame – consolidation – sought to encourage active enthusiasm for the regime, as distinct from mere support.

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 240 · Location 5388

‘ The art of policing is in punishing infrequently and severely, ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 242 · Location 5431

‘ If you make war, employ severity and activity; it is the only means by which you make it shorter, and consequently less deplorable for humanity. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 244 · Location 5476

‘ My intention is that everything is printed, absolutely everything except obscene material and anything that might disturb the tranquillity of the State. Censorship should pay no attention to anything else. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 247 · Location 5536

They put the Tuileries to good use, throwing dinners for two hundred people every ten days.

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 247 · Location 5539

Napoleon collected twenty-two statues of his heroes for the grand gallery, starting, inevitably, with Alexander and Julius Caesar but

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 248 · Location 5556

Napoleon cut it off, called for a valet, told him to dress in ordinary clothes and inquire the price in several shops and order a dozen. When he discovered they were one-third cheaper than billed he simply struck one-third off the charges made by all the tradesmen.

### Highlight (yellow) - 10: Consul > Page 248 · Location 5559

‘ It was part of the First Consul’s policy ’, recalled Laure d’Abrantès, ‘ to make Paris the centre of pleasure it had been before the Revolution. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 11: Marengo > Page 258 · Location 5737

Faith, for Napoleon, was an evolving concept, even a strategic one. When he said he adopted the faith of wherever he was fighting at the time he was quite serious, and in northern Italy that meant Roman Catholicism.

### Highlight (yellow) - 11: Marengo > Page 267 · Location 5877

‘ The fate of a battle is the result of a single instant – a thought, ’ Napoleon was later to say about Marengo. ‘ The decisive moment comes, a moral spark is lit, and the smallest reserve accomplishes victory. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 11: Marengo > Page 269 · Location 5932

For all his military genius, intellectual capacity, administrative ability and plain hard work, one should not underestimate the part that sheer good luck played in Napoleon’s career.

### Highlight (yellow) - 12: Lawgiver > Page 272 · Location 5997

‘ The idea of God is very useful, ’ Napoleon said, ‘ to maintain good order, to keep men in the path of virtue and to keep them from crime. ’ 19 ‘ To robbers and galley slaves, physical restrictions are imposed, ’ he said to Dr Barry O’Meara on St Helena, ‘ to enlightened people, moral ones. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 12: Lawgiver > Page 276 · Location 6077

Napoleon’s constant refrain on questions of ‘ the general interest ’ and civil justice were : ‘ Is this fair? Is this useful? ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 12: Lawgiver > Page 277 · Location 6094

One should not overburden oneself with over-detailed laws, ’ Napoleon told the Conseil. ‘ Law must do nothing but impose a general principle. It would be vain if one were to try to foresee every possible situation; experience would prove that much has been omitted. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 12: Lawgiver > Page 278 · Location 6119

the Code reflects Napoleon’s profound sexism : ‘ Women should not be looked upon as equals of men, ’ he said. ‘ They are, in fact, only machines for making babies. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 12: Lawgiver > Page 282 · Location 6204

He was not at all embarrassed by the little knowledge he had about the details of general administration. He asked many questions, asked for the definition and meaning of the most common words; he provoked discussion and kept it going until his opinion was formed. In one debate this man, who is so often portrayed as a raging egomaniac, admitted to the aged and respected jurist François Tronchet ‘ Sometimes in these discussions I have said things which a quarter of an hour later I have found were all wrong. I have no wish to pass for being worth more than I really am. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 12: Lawgiver > Page 282 · Location 6217

When members were tired during all-night sessions he would say : ‘ Come, sirs, we haven’t earned our salaries yet! ’ 69 (After they ended, sometimes at 5 a.m., he would take a bath, in the belief that ‘ One hour in the bath is worth four hours of sleep to me. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 12: Lawgiver > Page 282 · Location 6220

His councillors bear uniform witness – whether they later supported or abandoned him, whether they were writing contemporaneously or long after his fall – to his deliberative powers, his dynamism, the speed with which he grasped a subject, and the tenacity never to let it go until he had mastered its essentials and taken the necessary decision.

### Highlight (yellow) - 12: Lawgiver > Page 284 · Location 6248

A proposed decree would be read out, then the specialist committee’s report on it, and then Napoleon urged acknowledged experts on the subject to speak. The tone was matter-of-fact, and attempts at oratorical grandstanding tended only to inspire derision.

### Highlight (yellow) - 12: Lawgiver > Page 284 · Location 6255

Although it is too early to say whether the institutions Napoleon put in place will last as long as Caesar’s, he clearly put down what he called ‘ some masses of granite as anchors in the soul of France ’.

### Highlight (yellow) - 13: Plots > Page 295 · Location 6451

To the courier carrying his message of friendship to Tsar Alexander, Napoleon said : ‘ Go, sir, gallop, and don’t forget that the world was made in six days. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 13: Plots > Page 297 · Location 6464

(Napoleon’s understanding of naval affairs was dismal. He never truly grasped that the British ability to fire broadsides far more often per minute made the sheer numbers of ships in any engagement largely irrelevant, and that blockading France at sea strengthened rather than weakened British fighting ability.)

### Highlight (yellow) - 15: Coronation > Page 328 · Location 7127

When General Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult, who was in charge at Saint-Omer (77 letters) reported that it was impossible to embark the entire force in twenty-four hours, Napoleon expostulated, ‘ Impossible, sir! I am not acquainted with the word; it is not in the French language, erase it from your dictionary. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 15: Coronation > Page 334 · Location 7267

Meanwhile Savary, who commanded a separate secret police unit from Fouché as Napoleon didn’t like placing too much power in Fouché’s hands, went to Biville

### Highlight (yellow) - 15: Coronation > Page 341 · Location 7417

The only way to make his work ‘ immortal ’ was to create an ‘ other institution ’ that would secure his legacy and guarantee the stability of the state in the event that a future assassin should succeed. It was felt that the uncertainty of succession would serve to fuel plots.

### Highlight (yellow) - 15: Coronation > Page 342 · Location 7432

Napoleon told the actor Talma, who happened to be present, ‘ At this moment we are talking as if we are having a conversation, well, we are making history! ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 15: Coronation > Page 343 · Location 7465

Napoleon severely reprimanded Pauline for her infidelities in Rome. ‘ Do not count on me to help, ’ he warned her, ‘ if at your age you let yourself be governed by bad advice. ’

### Highlight (yellow) - 15: Coronation > Page 344 · Location 7477

The marshalate wasn’t a military rank but an honorific one intended to recognize and reward something that Napoleon later called ‘ the sacred fire ’, and of course to incentivize the rest of the high command. 99 The title came with a silver and velvet baton studded with gold eagles in a box of red Moroccan leather and indicated that Napoleon considered these men to be the fourteen best military commanders in the French army.

### Highlight (yellow) - 15: Coronation > Page 349 · Location 7581

Soldiers prized the medals, promotions, pensions and recognition that came directly from Napoleon far above the previous revolutionary concepts of self-sacrifice for the common good that the Jacobins had tried to inculcate into the army of the ‘ Republic of Virtue ’ in the 1790s.

A few days after the coronation the army’s colonels descended on Paris to receive eagle standards from the Emperor in a ceremony on the Champ de Mars. ‘ Soldiers! ’ he told them, ‘ here are your colours!

one appreciates the importance of the high morale and esprit de corps that Napoleon did so much to instil in his men. In the course of the fighting a grenadier of the former Army of Egypt lay wounded on his back in the pelting rain crying ‘ Forwards! ’, so Napoleon, who recognized him, took off his own cloak and threw it over him, saying : ‘ Try to bring this back to me, and in exchange I will give you the decoration and the pension that you have so well deserved. ’

Conversation with him always had a charm for me, difficult to define. Seizing the essential point of subjects, stripping them of useless accessories, developing his thought and never ceasing to elaborate it till he had made it perfectly clear and conclusive, always finding the fitting word for the thing, or inventing one where the image of language had not created it, his conversation was ever full of interest.

the concepts of liberty, equality and fraternity are mutually exclusive. A society can be formed around two of them, but never all three.

At home as on campaign, he slept only when he needed to, regardless of the time of day. ‘ If he slept, ’ his finance minister Comte Molé recalled, ‘ it was only because he recognized the need for sleep and because it renewed the energies he would require later. ’ 35 He needed seven hours ’ sleep in twenty-four, but he slept, as one secretary recalled, ‘ in several short naps, broken at will during the night as in the day ’. 36 Since his bedroom was close to his study in all his palaces, he could be at work in his dressing-gown at any time of the day or night, with his secretaries on rotations to take dictation. ‘ He used to get up, ’ recalled another secretary, ‘ after an hour’s sleep, as wide awake and as clear in the head as if he had slept quietly the whole night. ’
