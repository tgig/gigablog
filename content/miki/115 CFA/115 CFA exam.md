# CFA Exam

I signed up to take the CFA exam in Feb 21.

Here are resources:

Wow, here we go. Little bit intimidated right now.

# Study objective

There are 10 topic areas and 19 study sessions (some topics have multiple study sessions). Each study session has many Learning Outcome Statements (LOS).

The test questions come directly from the LOS, so I'm going to focus on obtaining and memorizing that knowledge.

I organized this portion of the ZK in exactly the way CFA does, as described above. I will create a note for each LOS and enter in my condensed notes to address the command.

## Study plan

This is the plan. Keep it updated for progress.
