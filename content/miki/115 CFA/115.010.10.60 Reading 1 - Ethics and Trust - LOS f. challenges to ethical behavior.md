Name the two challenges to ethical behavior

Why can overconfidence bias be a challenge to ethical behavior?
Overconfidence bias is a challenge to ethical behavior because we assume we are good people and sometimes make decisions based on our own moral compass without serious ethical reflection.

Why can situational influences be a challenge to ethical conduct?
Situational influences can motivate people to act in their short-term interests without recognizing the long-term risks or consequences for themselves or others.

Financial rewards, prestige, and loyalty to an employer and colleagues.
