## h. describe intermarket analysis as it relates to technical analysis and asset allocation.

What is intermarket analysis?
Intermarket analysis is the analysis of more than one related asset class or financial market to determine the strength or weakness of the financial markets or asset classes being considered. Instead of looking at financial markets or asset classes on an individual basis, this type of analysis looks at several strongly correlated markets or asset classes (such as stocks, bonds and commodities).
