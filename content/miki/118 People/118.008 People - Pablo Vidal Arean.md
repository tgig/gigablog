# Pablo Vidal Arean

I met Pablo at the Stanford Executive Program, we were in the same group. We became lifelong friends. He is one of the people who I admire for all of his being. He lives life to the fullest, he is smart, driven, thoughtful, fun, and accomplished.

I started [[111  Epic]] with him.
