# Professor Christopher Ittner

I took a coursera course [[20200630 Wharton Accounting Analytics]] and Ittner was one of the professors. He talks about building causal models to connect non-financial operational metrics to financial outcomes. This is very similar to what Pablo and I had been saying for months. So I decided to dive in.

A few of the things that I got value out of.
