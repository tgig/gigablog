# Utility

**Utility == usefulness/worth/value/happiness**

**"Utility units"** is an arbitrary number that can be used as a relative measurement against other options.

**Total utility** = the total amount of utility units you accrue as you add more units of whatever you're measuring. E.g. Ice cream - 1 scoop = 80 t/u, 2 scoops = 140 t/u (you get more utility out of two scoops than one scoop)

**Marginal utility** = the difference between units of whatever you're measuring. E.g in the ice cream example you got a marginal utility of 80 units going from zero to one, and a marginal utility of 60 going from one to two scoops.
