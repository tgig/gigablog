# First Principles Thinking

First principles thinking is breaking down something which seems obvious into its individual underlying facts, ideas, and assumptions and re-building a solution from those basic truths. It allows us to think for ourselves, despite the conditioning of society. It is good for creating new solutions to old problems without simply following the way its always been done.
