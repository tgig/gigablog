# It's not an attack

When you are directing or receiving a First Principles exploration, it can often feel contentious because you're exploring base assumptions which often go unsaid/unacknowledged and are baked into our culture. To try and extract words from somebody to describe why they believe these things to be true can easily feel like an attack. BE SURE to make it clear that you are not attacking, you're just trying to understand and learn. Don't end up like Socrates.
