# Return to the same thoughts over time

Like DaVinci returning to his Mona Lisa, Lincoln would use the process of "cumulative thought" to hone his points, arguments, decisions. He would write something down and return to it over time to refine it.

He would often return to a theme or story, and he held true to his beliefs over the course of his life, refining them and making them more clear in his mind and the mind of others.
