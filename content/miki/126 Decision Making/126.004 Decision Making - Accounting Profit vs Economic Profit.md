# Accounting Profit vs. Economic Profit

A rational agent considers both accounting profit and economic profit.

Accounting profit is the net profit of a firm. These are the _explicit_ factors.
- E.g. the "accounting profit" of moving to a new house/place is the amount of money you _save_ vs staying were you are.

To calculate whether it is rational to continue running the business (or running the business in this way) you need to calculate the _implicit_ factors as well. E.g., the opportunity cost. 

Economic Profit will never be higher than accounting profit assuming there are some implicit costs to factor in.
