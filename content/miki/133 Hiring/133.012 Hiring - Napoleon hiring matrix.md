# Napoleon's hiring matrix

When asked how he assigned soldiers within his ranks, Napoleon gave the following matrix:
```
                Smart        Dumb
           |-------------|------------|
Energetic  | Field       | Shoot      |
           | Commander   |            |
           |-------------|------------|
Lazy       | General     | Foot       |
           |             | Soldier    |
           |-------------|------------|
```

> - The smart and energetic I make field commanders. They know what to do and can rally the troops to do it.
> - The smart and lazy I make generals. They also know what to do, but they’re not going to waste energy doing what doesn’t need to be done.
> - The dumb and lazy I make foot soldiers.
> 
> But what about the dumb and energetic? “Those,” Napoleon replied, “I shoot.”
