# Can I trust this developer?

If you have to wonder whether a develop could do any particular semi-complicated job, they're probably not a good fit for the young team. E.g. If I have to wonder if a dev could do a project which involves a new model, database change, associated tests, and the answer is "No" or "I don't know", that's a BIG RED FLAG. 

At a startup, I don't have time to mentor raw recruits, and the team deserves to work with other developers who are as good and fast as they are. One bad developer reduces the productivity and morale of the entire team.
