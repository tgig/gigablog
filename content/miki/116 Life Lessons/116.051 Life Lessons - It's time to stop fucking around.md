# It's time to stop fucking around.

The process was fun. Learning was good. Now do the thing and move to the next level. Do something people will pay money for, do it a lot of times - it's not a complicated idea. The problem is: people pay money for things that cost money and are hard or not fun to do themselves... that's why they'll pay for it. I will do the hard, un-fun, non-glorious, dirty work, with a smile on my face, because I know something they don't: I'm moving to the next level.
