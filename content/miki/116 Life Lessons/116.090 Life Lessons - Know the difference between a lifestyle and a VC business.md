# Know the difference between a lifestyle and VC business

A lifestyle business is not a bad thing. But know this before you try to squeeze it into a VC model. If I had known this when doing sbs, I probably would not have sought capital, and almost certainly would not have hired a full-time CEO.

(Though, to be fair, I probably would not have ended up in Silicon Valley, either)
