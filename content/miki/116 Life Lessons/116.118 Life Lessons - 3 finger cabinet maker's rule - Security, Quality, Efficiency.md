# The 3-finger cabinet maker's rule

Hold up 3-fingers parallel to the ground, with your index finger on top.

```
GOOD! You're safe!
------------->     Index finger = Security
---------------->  Middle finger = Quality
-------------->    Ring finger = Efficiency
```

The first finger is Security. The second is Quality. The third is Efficiency. Follow these things in that order at all times, because if you flip your fingers upside down, then you cut them off.

```
BAD! You lost your fingers
------||-------->    Ring finger = Efficiency
------||---------->  Middle finger = Quality
------||------->     Index finger = Security
```

Seppo Rinta from my Stanford SEP class, who has retired into the life of a cabinet maker, taught me this rule in Porto during a class reunion.
