# When I allow my emotions to override my higher consciousness...

When I allow my emotions to override my higher consciousness, I am likely to say things I will regret and feel things that aren't necessary. When I stay aware of my feelings and reactions, when I am present, I am much more likely to embody the human I want to be - thoughtful, logical, empathic, forward-thinking. I am less likely to get into unnecessary arguments and more likely to learn something about myself or the other person.
