# Work with people you are in awe of

The people you are in awe of make the best partners and employees. They have your respect for a reason - they earned it somehow, usually through past accomplishments. They are capable of doing the same again.

It doesn't pay to work with people who you are not awed by. If you know their job better than they do, they're not going to make `2+2=5`. In some cases they will make `2+2=3`, a recipe for failure. (In case you forget yourself and hire somebody who doesn't immediately show immense value, see the [[116.061 Life Lessons - Fire fast]] rule)
