# Simple is better. Always

It is hard but important to make something simple. Especially when that thing is difficult and complex.

"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" - Leonardo da Vinci

"In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness" - Yvon Chouinard - founder of Patagonia

"I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter" - Blaise Pascal
