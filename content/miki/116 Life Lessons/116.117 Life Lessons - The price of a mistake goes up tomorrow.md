# The price of a mistake goes up tomorrow

"Itâ€™s always cheapest to pay for a mistake today; tomorrow the cost goes up." - Parenting with Love and Logic

_tl;dr_: Do today what can be done today. Say today what could be said today. The price of waiting is not (usually) worth it.

If I make a mistake and I know it, own it now, even if it will hurt. The loss of faith or trust in the moment will be less than the cost of it later. Oftentimes the amount of trust actually goes _UP_ when being transparent. Not to mention, the effects of compounded learning that comes from confronting mistakes, admitting them, learning from them, and moving on, can't be measured.
