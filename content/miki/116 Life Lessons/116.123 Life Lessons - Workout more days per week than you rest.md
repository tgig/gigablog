# Workout more days per week than you rest

A workout is a payment for a good life, with interest that compounds. Seneca says "the body should be treated rigorously, that it may not be disobedient to the mind."

Working out keeps me feeling good, thinking sharp, and happy. 

Working out trains my brain and willpower to push a little further, to hear but ignore subconscious weakness, that I can do more than I think.

Working out more days per week than I rest is the cadence which works best for me and ensures that I dont get lazy with the routine.
