# 100% of the time is easier than 99% of the time

Lou Gherig owned the baseball record for most games played in a row. He played through sickness, injury, and aging. He showed up and performed at a high enough level to keep his professional baseball job for 17 seasons and 2,130 games, until an uncurable disease stopped him. 

He was human like us all, but he would not accept less than the best of himself, he would not compromise for any reason. Self-compromise is a slippery slope, and once you start accepting compromise, it's easier to do it again next time, and then you can't stop...

Once you introduce even the possibility that you can get away with something, do it with half effort, not do it at all... then you will! You introduce the ability to be tired, to change your mind, and forget.

So, if it is important, if you truly have conviction about something, if you commit, then follow through on your commitments 100% of the time.
