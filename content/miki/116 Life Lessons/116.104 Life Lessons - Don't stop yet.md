# Don't stop yet!

I'm running. 

My brain tells me to slow down and walk. 

If I always listened to my subconscious, I would not have accomplished half of what I have in this life. So I can't stop running... yet.

Instead, I said a goal for a point where I'm going to stop, and I don't stop until I've hit it. Then I can walk.

> Did you think this was only about running? This is about _everything_ that's providing value in life!
