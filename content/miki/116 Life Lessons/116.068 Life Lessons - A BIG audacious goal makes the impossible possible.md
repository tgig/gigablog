# A BIG audacious goal makes the impossible possible

When I started Swing by Swing, I set the goal:

"We will be the worlds most used golf software company within 4 years"

And we hit it. It was a big goal, but it gave us something to strive for.


My senior year of high school basketball, our coach asked us all, at the beginning of the season, in front of each other, what we wanted to accomplish. There was no acceptable answer other than:

"I want to win the state championship"

And we did. Once the goal was set, there was nothing else to do but work to achieve it.
