# David Hite on raising teens: Predictability and Confidence

My friend David often tells me that his rule for allowing teens to do anything depended on the answers for two things:

1. Is it predictable?
2. Can I have confidence in it?

**Kid:** Dad, can I go to my friends house for the night?
**Dad:** Yes, because I can predict where you'll be and I have confidence because you've done it before.

**Kid:** Dad, can I sleep on the beach in Punta Mita this weekend?
**Dad:** No! I can't predict where you'll be or what you'll be doing, and I have little confidence that it will work out the way we think.
