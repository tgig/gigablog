# Industry is destiny

Industry is destiny. Choose the right industry and things will be easy. Choose wrong and you're doomed no matter how good you are. The same thing goes for people.

It was first told to me by Professor Burgelman during the Stanford Executive Program. Paraphrasing: _"Industry is destiny! You can be the best CEO in the world, but if you work in the airline industry you'll deliver mediocre returns to investors. Or you can be a mediocre CEO in a fast growing industry like technology and deliver outstanding returns."__
