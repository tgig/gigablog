# Finish what you start

Only undertake those things that are right and good. Once you start something, finish it!

_"But so long as there is no prohibition from the voice within, I must continue the writing. I must follow the sage maxim that nothing once begun should be abandoned unless it is proved to be morally wrong."_ - Gandhi

_"Once you undertake to do something, stick with it and treat it as something that should be carried through."_ - Epictetus

_"The chief gem of my character is the ability to keep resolves when they are made. "_ - Abraham Lincoln
