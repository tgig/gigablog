# Don't be short sighted when it comes to delegation of tasks

It may take you a little more time to develop the documentation or checklist which allows somebody else to do one of your mundane tasks, but it will save you a ton of time in the future and you will be free do something much more important. Not to mention, things will probably get done a lot quicker and more reliably if you offload them from your responsibility. Just be sure to keep good management of these offloaded tasks.
