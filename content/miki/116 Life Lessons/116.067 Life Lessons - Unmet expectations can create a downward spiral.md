# Unmet expectations can create a downward spiral that feeds on itself

Once upon a time I had a company, and we were trying to sell it to another company. They were dragging their feet, and I expected everything to move faster... When I constantly expected the acquisition to go through, but nothing happened, I spiraled down. 

In order to get the acquisition to go through, I had to negotiate my new salary, and it was lower than I'd hoped to make. Once again, my expectations were not met and once again, I spiraled down.
