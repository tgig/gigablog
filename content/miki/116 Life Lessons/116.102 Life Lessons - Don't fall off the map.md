# Don't ~~fall~~ stay off the map

As far as my friends and family are concerned, I fell off the map when I met my wife and started a career. I quit communicating with them because I was focused on myself, my wife, and my career. When I had a family it got even worse.

As my marriage enters it's 21st year, and my kids are getting old enough to have their own interests, I am finally realizing that those relationships are _important_, and I want to nurture them back to life.

I know that [[116.049 Life Lessons - You get what you give|you get what you give]], and the only way I'll be successful at re-establishing my relationships, or creating rewarding new ones, is by a steady cadence of communication with empathy.
