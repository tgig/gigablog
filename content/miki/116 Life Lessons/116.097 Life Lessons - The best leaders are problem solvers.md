# The best leaders are problem solvers

The best leaders are problem solvers. 

It does not matter if they are solving a problem they know a lot about, or something they've never encountered. There is always a way to solve the problem, and it always requires the input, effort, and good will of other groups of people. Which means an effective leader must not only be effective at solving problems, but finding the right people to help, and motivating them appropriately.
