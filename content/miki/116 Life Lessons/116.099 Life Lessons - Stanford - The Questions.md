# Stanford: The Questions

AT STANFORD, I did not learn the answers. I learned the questions. Ask yourself these questions and the right thing to do will become clear.

- What is the most obvious thing to do?
- How could it be simplified?
- What could kill us?
- If I was replaced by a smart person, what would she do?
- What does winning mean?
- What would a hustler do?
- What would I do if I had $1B?
- What would they do 100 years in the future?
- What happens when you think just 2 steps ahead?
