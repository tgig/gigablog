# Render yourself worthy

Lincoln was intelligent and ambitious beyond normal limits. His driving motivation was to "render himself worthy" of his fellow man's esteem, and he would not allow a lesser outcome, even when so severely depressed that he wanted to commit suicide. 

Lincoln started life uneducated in the backwoods. His ambition pulled him up, despite poverty, death, depression, defeat. He read books every moment possible, studied law at night after working all day, memorized stories, ran for office (usually losing), took difficult legal cases. Once he began to form a name, he didn't stop. Once he became president he didn't stop. Only death could stop him from trying to render himself worthy.
