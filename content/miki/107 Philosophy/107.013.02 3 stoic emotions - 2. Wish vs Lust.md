# Wish vs. Lust

Wish vs Lust (Appetite) is subtle. We can Wish for something without our Joy relying upon it. When we have an Appetite for something we pursue it and we desire it because we think it will be good, and our happiness is dependent upon achieving it. Wishing, on the other hand, is more like saying that I desire something, but my happiness is not dependent upon it. It is a shift in perspective.
