# Stoic virtues - Courage

## The definition of courage

Courage is persisting in what you know is right against odds, against power, against normal reason. Even at the expense of your own life and reputation, even if futile, because it's the right thing to do. 

Courage to face misfortune. Courage to face death. Courage to risk yourself for the sake of your fellow man. Courage to hold to your principles, even when others get away with or are rewarded for disregarding theirs. Courage to speak your mind and insist on truth

## Quotes on temperance

So it is for us - each person's life is a kind of battle, and a long and varied one too. You must keep watch like a soldier and do everything commanded... You have been stationed in a key post , not some lowly place, and not for a short time but for life."_

Epictetus was asked which words would help a person thrive. _"Two words should be committed to memory and obeyed: persist and resist."_
