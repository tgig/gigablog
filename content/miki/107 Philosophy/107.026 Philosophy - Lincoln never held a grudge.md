# Lincoln never held a grudge

Lincoln did not harbor grudges. He only ever showed respect and empathy to others.
"You have more of that feeling of personal resentment than I. A man has not time to spend half his life in quarrels. If any man ceases to attack me, I never remember the past against him." - Lincoln

_"Probably no other man than Lincoln would have had ... the degree of magnanimity to thus forgive and exalt a rival who had so deeply and so unjustifiably intrigued against him. It is however only another most marked illustration of the greatness of the President"_ - Nicolay
