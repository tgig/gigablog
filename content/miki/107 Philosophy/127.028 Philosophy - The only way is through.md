# The only way is through

"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way." - Marcus Aurelius

While this is a very stoic thought, it was also Lincoln's. He endured great hardships and defeats and pushed straight through. He wrote a young cadet who was having a hard time "I am older than you, have felt badly myself, and know, what I tell you is true. Adhere to your purpose and you will soon feel as well as you ever did. On the contrary, if you falter, and give up, you will lose the power of keeping any resolution, and will regret it all your life."
