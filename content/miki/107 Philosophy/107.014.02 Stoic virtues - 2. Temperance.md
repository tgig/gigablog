# Stoic virtues - Temperance


## The definition of temperance

Aristotle says temperance is the _"golden mean"_ , that virtue is found firmly in the middle, between excess and deficiency. Excess and desire is synonymous with discontent and dissatisfaction. They are a self-defeating impulse.

## Quotes on temperance

Marcus Aurelius: _"'If you seek tranquility, do less.' Or (more accurately) do what's essential - what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, 'Is this necessary?'"_

Epictetus: _"Curb your desire - don't set your heart on so many things and you will get what you need."_

Seneca: _"You ask what is the poper limit to a person's wealth? First, having what is essential, and second, having what is enough."_

Temperance is the knowledge that abundance comes from having what is essential.
Temperance can be used interchangeably with "self control".
