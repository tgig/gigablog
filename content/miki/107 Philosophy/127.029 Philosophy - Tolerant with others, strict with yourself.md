# Tolerant with others, strict with yourself

Taken directly from [[125.015 Books - Discipline is Destiny - Ryan Holiday]]:

_“I am prepared to forgive everybody’s mistakes,” Cato the Elder said, “except my own.” Ben Franklin, many generations later, would put forth an even better rule: “Search others for their virtues, thyself for thy vices.” Or as Marcus Aurelius put it, Tolerant with others, strict with yourself._ - Ryan Holiday
