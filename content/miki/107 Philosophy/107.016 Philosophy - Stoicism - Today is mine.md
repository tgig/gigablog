# Today is the same as yesterday.

Yesterday was the same as Friday.
Tomorrow will be the same as today.

I get to choose, in every moment, if I'm doing something that will be valuable, or something that is simply wasting time.

Even this moment.

But I won't be fooled. My time in this beautiful moment is limited. My time is mine. My time is open. There is only one thing on my calendar today, and I put it there. Soon it will be filled with other people's agendas and priorities.

So, Travis, what will you do with this beautiful day?
