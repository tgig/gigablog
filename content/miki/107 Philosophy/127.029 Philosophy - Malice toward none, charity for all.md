# Malice toward none, charity for all

Upon knowing his absolute victory, at long last, there wasn't a trace of pride or smugness or vanity in the President. He seemed as if a great sadness had been released, but he did not gloat, did not punish. In fact, he said quite the opposite in his second inauguration address just one month before being assassinated: 

_"With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphanâ€”to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations."_

Amazing.
