# Examine yourself whether you wish to be rich or to be happy.

If you wish to be rich, you should know that it is neither a good thing nor at all in your power: but if you wish to be happy, you should know that it is both a good thing and in your power, for the one is a temporary loan of fortune, and happiness comes from the will.

Epictetus, Enchiridion, Fragments, XIX
