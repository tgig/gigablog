# Virtue through purpose

John Brown was an abolitionist who, among other things, attempted to incite a slave revolt at Harpers Ferry. He was caught and executed for it. After his trial and death sentence, but before it was carried out, his letters are pure Socrates. And like Socrates, he became a martyr for his cause: 

_"I am waiting the hour of my public murder with great composure of mind, & cheerfulness, feeling the strongest assurance that in no other possible way could I be used to so much advance the cause of God; & of humanity."_

His virtue, which lives on in infamy long after his death, was a direct result of his purpose, which he maintained even in the face of public death. Knowing that he was serving his highest and best _purpose_ with conviction and bravery... amazing.
