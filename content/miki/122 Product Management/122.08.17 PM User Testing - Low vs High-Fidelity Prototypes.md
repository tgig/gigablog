# Low vs High-Fidelity Prototypes

All prototypes are simulations of a product.

- **Low-fidelity prototypes** are intentionally designed to look like wireframes, sketched on paper. They are quick-and-dirty ways to simulate something without looking like a finished product.
- **High-fidelity prototypes** are designed to look and feel like a real product, perhaps so lifelike that it can be difficult to tell that it is only a simulation. These are the preferred variety for [[122.08.16 PM User Testing - Value Tests High-Fidelity Prototypes|value testing]].
