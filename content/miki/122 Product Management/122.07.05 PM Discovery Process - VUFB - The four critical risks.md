# The four critical risks

These are the four critical risks of launching a new product. We want to have satisfactory answers for each of these before moving into the product build/delivery phase:
- Risk 1: **Value risk** - Will customers buy (or use) this product?
- Risk 2: **Usability risk** - Can customers figure out how to use this product?
- Risk 3: **Feasibility risk** - Given our skills, technology, and time available, can our engineers build this product?
- Risk 4: **Business viability risk** - Does this solution work for the business in terms of financial investment, time, IRR? Does it work for the marketing, sales, customer success, finance, legal, etc., departments?
