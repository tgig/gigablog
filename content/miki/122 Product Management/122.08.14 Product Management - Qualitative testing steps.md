# Qualitative testing steps

A qualitative user test generally has the following steps:
1. **Interview** - make sure she has the problems we think she has, understand what it would take to make her switch
2. **Usability test** - can the user figure out how to use our prototype?
3. **Value test** - Will they pay for it? Would they recommend it to their friends? Are they willing to spend their time to help make it better? Will they give up sensitive information for it?
