# B2B Product/Market Fit: Finding reference customers

The best way to find reference customers is to recruit people/companies who truly feel the pain that your solution is trying to solve.

The customer is so hungry for a solution that they will make time and have patience for your half-ass, buggy, minimum featured product.
