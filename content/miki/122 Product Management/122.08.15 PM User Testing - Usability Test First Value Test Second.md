# Usability Test First, Value Test Second

The user of our product must know how to use the product before we can attempt to determine whether she would pay for it with money/time/reputation/etc. If you try to do value testing without first doing usability testing, it's more like a focus group where people are talking hypothetically about your product.

Do the value test immediately after the usability test, while it is still fresh in their mind.
