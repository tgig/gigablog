# How to decide if a task belongs on the story map

A good metaphor for a task that belongs on a story map: They are tasks we’d expect to complete before intentionally stopping to do something else. E.g., you don’t get halfway through a shower in the morning and think, "Man, this shower is dragging on. I think I’ll grab a cup of coffee and finish this shower later."
