# Communication Skills

In order to be persuasive, a professional product manager should have strong skills in both oratory and written communication. As a PM, you spend 1/3 of your time with each of reading/writing/speaking. 
1. First, **reading** gives you the arguments to make your case.
2. Then, you **write** them down in a an extraordinarily clear and precise brief which presents airtight logic for why we're doing this and why it's important. 
3. Finally, you must be able to **speak** extemporaneously to people about it.
