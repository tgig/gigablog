# Always use a drawing for shared understanding

Any time, every time, that I'm talking with people about something new, create a visualization for it - just write something down on a shared board. As we talk about it, add context, draw photos, let others add their content. If/when that idea comes back up in conversation later on, everybody will remember it more-or-less the same way.
