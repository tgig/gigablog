# Successful products require iterations

Most successful products require several iterations of product delivery to produce the value that customers need to feel comfortable using and/or switching to it. Part of the product process is to uncover these kinds of risks, but in the real world product development often take longer than expected, is more complicated, more costly, and sometimes does not provide the value management was hoping for.

But this inconvenient truth is no reason to avoid the process, it is simply a reason to embrace the iterative approach and look for creative ways to provide value as quickly as possible, and uncover as much product wisdom as possible before and during product development.
