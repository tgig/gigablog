# Great products require teamwork

Great products are exclusively the result of a small group of talented people working closely together to solve real problems for end users and customers in ways that meet the needs of the business. Functionality, design, and technology are completely intertwined and integrated, and it takes the talents of multiple people with good working relationships and a good understanding of the customer and their problems to pull it all together.
