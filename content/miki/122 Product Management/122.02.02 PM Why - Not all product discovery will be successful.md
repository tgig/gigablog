# Not all product discovery will be successful

Not all products are going to be successful. Even the most talented product team will fail to produce a profitable and successful product when it doesn't make sense. If any of the primary risks can't be overcome, and constraints won't allow for creativity, and customers don't want the same product that management wants, the product discovery process will fail. This is inevitable sometimes, but having a fast, iterative process, with good communication, will prevent it from happening more often than necessary.

This outcome is not necessarily a failure. Knowing that a product won't work in advance of it being built saves the company time and money and opportunity cost.
