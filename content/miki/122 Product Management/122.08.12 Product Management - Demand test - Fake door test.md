# Testing demand: The fake door test

To test demand there are multiple version of the "fake door" test. 
- If you have **an existing product**, put a button for a new feature into the place it would normally go. When the user clicks the button, instead of seeing the actual functionality they see a message that explains how you're exploring the possibility of adding this feature and are looking for customers to talk to about it. Then give them a way to reach out.
- If you're launching **a new product**, you place Google/Facebook Ads and send people to a landing page which simulates the start of the sales funnel. If they click the CTA button, instead of seeing more information about the product they see a page explaining the possibility of building this product to suit their needs and that you'd like to talk to them about it.
