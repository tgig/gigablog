# Product management is similar to being an entrepreneur

The product manager role seems very similar to the entrepreneurial role because you need to be good at a lot of different things in order to be successful. You have to have the capability for high level strategic thinking and the willingness for getting low-level-shit done.

By the same logic:

Entrepreneurialism is very similar to product management. You have to determine what problem you're going to solve, then why and how it should be solved, then convince the right people that it should exist, get them on board, make it real, and iterate to provide the promised value.
