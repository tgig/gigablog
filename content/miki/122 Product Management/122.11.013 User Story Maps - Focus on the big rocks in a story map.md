# Focus on the "big rocks" in a story map

Story maps are not a place for details. Focus on the "big rocks" in the story map, because you can always break it up into "small rocks" later on. However, if a "big rock" can be broken down into "little rocks" in different ways (e.g. different types of users) then put this detail below the big rock.
