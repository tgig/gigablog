# Product management in two sentences

Put simply, Product Managers have two responsibilities:

1. **Find a product that addresses the four major new product risks**. Most notably the "value" and "business viability" risks - because the company needs people who need the product, and it needs this to happen before it runs out of money and time.
2. **Deliver a robust and scalable implementation of that product** which customers can consistently rely on to provide value.
