# Types of Value tests

All of the below are indications that the product has _value_ in the eye of the user. None of these necessarily need to be followed through at this point - e.g., you don't _have to_ take the credit card - you just need to know that it was going to happen.

1. **Money** - will they give you a credit card or offer to pay for the product? Ask for their credit card.
2. **Reputation** - will the person recommend and share this with their friends? Ask them to send an email to their friends.
3. **Time** - are they willing to spend their precious time working with you on this? Ask to schedule their time.
4. **Access** - will they provide login credentials for the service they would be switching from? Tell them there is a migration utility or something like that.
