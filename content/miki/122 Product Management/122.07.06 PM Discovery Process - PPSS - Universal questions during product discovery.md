# Universal questions during product discovery

At every step, with every experiment, every conversation, and every written communication, the product discovery process requires a PM to always be asking:
- PEOPLE: Are your customers who you think they are? 
- PROBLEM: Do they really have the problems you think they have? 
- SOLUTION: How does the customer solve this problem today? 
- SWITCH: What would be required for them to switch?

P.P.S.S. == 
```
PEOPLE =	Purple
PROBLEM = Pants
SOLUTION = Start
SWITCH =    Stories
```
People Pocket Sandwiches Silently
Ponzi Players Sing Songs
Pint Packets Stay Soft
**Purple Pants Start Stories**
Poodle puppies stay soft
**People Problem Solve Swiftly**

People - who are the users?
Problems - do they have the problems we think they do?
Solutions - What are the existing solutions they use to solve this problem?
Switch - What would it take for them to switch?
