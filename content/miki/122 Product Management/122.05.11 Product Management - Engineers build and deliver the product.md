# Engineers build and deliver the product

Engineers build and deliver the product. They are not as intimately involved in the day-to-day product discovery process as the PM and PD, but should be involved as often as possible because they (a) build the end product and (b) bring a technology perspective to the process. Engineer insights gained as part of the user testing and iteration process can sometimes be gained no other way than their involvement.
