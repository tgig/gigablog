# Workflow

The job flows like this:
1. Evaluate opportunity: What problem are you solving? Why is it important?
2. Design solution: Is it viable, what does it cost, how will it be done, how can it be sold?
3. Sell the opportunity: Clearly articulate the opportunity, influence management to undertake the project, influence a team to build the project
4. Build solution: Participate and manage the team to project completion
5. Ship the product: Roll the product out
6. Iterate: Measure, communicate up/down the chain, and improve
