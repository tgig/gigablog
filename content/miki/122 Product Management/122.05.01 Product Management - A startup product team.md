# A startup product team

In a startup, the product team is **the entire** team. The only purpose of a fledgling company is to find an appropriate product/market fit before it runs out of time and money. There are many considerations for what is "appropriate" and what is "product/market fit" for every company, but startups are in a race against time with more constraints than bigger companies with more resources, and it is exclusively the young product team who will determine future business viability.
