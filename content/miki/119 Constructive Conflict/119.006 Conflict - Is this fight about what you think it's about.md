# Is this fight actually about what you think it's about?

Be aware of the background thoughts and experiences of your and the other person. Is this fight really about the topic you're arguing over? Or is there some lingering frustration, or some underlying belief that is causing one of us to act or think irrationally? Oftentimes, pent up emotions cause arguments which didn't need to happen, or can be easily resolved by addressing the original frustration.
