# Constructive Conflict

There is much to learn in this life about communication. For me in the past, conflict was something to be avoided. But with communication comes conflict. And when done right, communication (and subsequent constructive conflict) can be productive, exploratory, and interesting.

[[119.001 Conflict - Seven steps to constructive conflict]]
[[119.002 Conflict - More communication means more conflict]]
[[119.003 Conflict - Are you there for me]]
[[119.004 Conflict - Choose the right time and place for a difficult conversation]]
[[119.005 Conflict - How to start difficult conversations]]
[[119.006 Conflict - Is this fight about what you think it's about]]
[[119.007 Conflict - Know what question you want answered]]
[[119.008 Conflict - Paraphrase the other person in order to have an efficient conversation]]
[[119.009 Conflict - Acknowledge feelings]]
[[119.010 Conflict - The 4 sins of conflict]]
[[119.011 Conflict - Safe words]]
[[119.012 Conflict - Know when to JUST STOP]]
[[119.013 Conflict - What's behind the impasse]]
[[119.014 Conflict - Memorialize your agreements]]

Notes: This is a book I picked up because I promised Monique that I would try to find something effective at helping us work through difficult conversations, to lock in and supplement the time we've spent with Michele.
