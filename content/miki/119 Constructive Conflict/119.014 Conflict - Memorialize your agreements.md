# Memorialize your agreements

When you have finally come to an agreement on some important topic, especially if it's an argument you've had more than once, WRITE IT DOWN. Don't try to remember what you decided, think of it as the minutes of a board meeting or a contract. If you can, set a reminder or calendar item to discuss the successful follow-up.
