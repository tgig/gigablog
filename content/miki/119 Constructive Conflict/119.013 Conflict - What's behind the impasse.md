# What's behind the impasse?

If at any point you can't figure out how to resolve differences and find a way forward, it is time to take a step back and figure out what fundamental underlying values and beliefs are driving each perspective. The only time we'll never be able to compromise is when we feel so strongly about our perspective that we won't give in, and the only reason we could feel that way is very deep seated. Take a break, then discuss (and acknowledge) the background story.
