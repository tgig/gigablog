# Sin 2 = Defensiveness

Sin 2 is defensiveness and it's about trying to deflect blame or place it on the other person. It is often a response to another sin, like defamation. When presented with something like "You're so selfish, you never think of anyone but yourself!", you'll be tempted to say "Well you're nagging bitch with control issues!", but with some clarity and presence it's easy to know that will not fix the problem, only make it worse. (Not to mention it's the defamation-in-return and purposefully trying to hurt the other person.) Instead, say "That's defamation. A foul. Can we start over? Can you give me specific examples?"
