# Avoiding defensiveness

To avoid being defensive, just take responsibility and don't make excuses. It's not hard to say "No, I haven't done that but I will now". Take responsibility and you take control of your life, this is one of the things you have control over, and therefore one of the things you need to work hard to be in charge of.
