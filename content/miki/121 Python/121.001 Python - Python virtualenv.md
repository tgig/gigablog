# Python virtualenv

`virtualenv` is a way to logically separate the computer environment you're working inside of, so that other libraries or configurations don't interfere with the current python project.

### Instal `virtualenv`

`pip install virtualenv`

### Install python `virtualenv` with python3
I always want to use `python3` these days because it is supported and some tools don't work with `python2.7`.

1. `virtualenv --python python3 venv`
    - virtualenv = command
    - --python python3 = initialize with python3
    - venv = name of the virtualenv (can be anything, but I always use "venv")
2. `. venv/bin/activate`
	- Activate the virtual environment (alternatively, could use `source venv/bin/activate`, but I like `.` b/c it is shorter)
