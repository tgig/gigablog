# Python virtualenv

`virtualenv` is a way to logically separate the computer environment you're working inside of, so that other libraries or configurations don't interfere with the current python project.

### Instal `virtualenv`

`pip install virtualenv`

### Install python `virtualenv` with python3
I always want to use `python3` these days because it is supported and some tools don't work with `python2.7`.

1. `virtualenv --python python3 venv`
    - `virtualenv` = command
    - `--python python3 `= initialize with python3
    - `venv` = name of the virtualenv (can be anything, but I always use "venv")
2. `. venv/bin/activate`
	- Activate the virtual environment (alternatively, could use `source venv/bin/activate`, but I like `.` b/c it is shorter)

### Install `venv` with `python3`

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58336300/creating-virtualenv-with-python3
`python3 -m venv venv`

To use `python3.9` instead of the default:
`python3.9 -m venv venv`
