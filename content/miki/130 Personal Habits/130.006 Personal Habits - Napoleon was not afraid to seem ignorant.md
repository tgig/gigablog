# Napoleon was not afraid to seem ignorant

Napoleon was not afraid to look ignorant to subordinates about topics he wanted to learn more about. He did not feel the urge of ego to look like he knew everything, he could be curious even about things that he should already have known to get into the position of power he occupied.

Imagine how the most powerful human in the world didn't care about looking foolish in front of somebody "below" him? If Napoleon can do this, I can do this too.
