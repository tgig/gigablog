# Napoleon was never seen drunk

He didn't abstain completely, he would occasionally enjoy a glass of wine, usually watered down. 

He was far too ambitious, busy, and curious to ever be drunk, it would have reduced his effectiveness, caused more sleep, resulted in poorer judgement and inability to retain knowledge. His nearly perfect memory could not have afforded hazy memories, his constant movement would have been slowed.
