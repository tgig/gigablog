# Ryan Holiday does not smoke, drink, or do drugs

_Aware of my tendency to do things compulsively, I donâ€™t drink or smoke or take recreational drugs of any kind._ - [[125.015 Books - Discipline is Destiny - Ryan Holiday]]

Ryan Holiday is the author of Daily Stoic, and I have received an email from him nearly every day for years. They are all opened and read, and I ponder the content on more days than not. He's written many related books and other daily newsletters. He has provided far far more value than he takes, and he's a person worth listening to.
