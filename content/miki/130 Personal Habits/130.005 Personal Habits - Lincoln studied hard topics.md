# Lincoln studied hard topics

Lincoln gravitated toward difficult subjects of study:

_"Life to him was a school and he was always studying and mastering every subject which came before him."_ - Leonard Swett, fellow circuit lawyer

_"he read hard works - was philosophical, logical, mathematical - never read generally"_ - John Stuart, his first law partner
