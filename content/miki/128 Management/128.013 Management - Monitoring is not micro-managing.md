# Monitoring is not meddling or micro-managing

Monitoring is not meddling or micro-managing. It is information gathering, fixing problems, quality assurance. This is the KPI/OKR focus which makes for good management decisions, productive use of time, and clear conversations. Monitoring is the difference between a supervisor's delegating a task and abdicating it.
The amount of monitoring necessary for an individual or team should be based on task-relevant maturity.
