# Task Relevant Maturity

Task-relevant maturity is an important concept to customize the amount of management/oversight that any individual needs. It is my job to understand the task-relevant maturity for each person on my team:
- Low TRM = almost micro-management, structured task relevant style (what, how, when)
- Medium TRM = structure is self-provided, emphasis on two-way communication, support, mutual reasoning
- High TRM = minimal involvement, mutually establish objectives and monitoring schedule
