# The trade-off between time and quality

There is always a push-and-pull from the business objectives that need to be met and the quality of the engineering or design that goes into them. There is a timeline to consider because if we don't deliver on a product we will run out of money or our competitors will deliver it before us. There is rarely a time in a startup that an engineer gets to spend all the time they want to make a beautiful and perfect system. Instead, they are forced to make trade-offs between what can be done well in the amount of time they have available.
