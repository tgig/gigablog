# OKRs start at the top

OKRs start from the top. The people under the top use a re-stated version of a "KR" from the person above them as their "Objective". This hierarchy allows every manager of people to "own" the work of themselves and all the people underneath them. It allows everybody to contribute UP toward the overall goals of the company.
