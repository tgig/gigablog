# Management is entirely about delegation

The concept of "management" is entirely about getting things done via delegation of tasks. Therefore, proper delegation of tasks is the highest leverage way for me to increase my output. My job is to understand what needs to be done, what resources are necessary to accomplish it, how to motivate, and how to delegate the tasks to people who are capable of doing it, then measuring the output and adjusting course as necessary.
