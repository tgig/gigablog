# Hold people accountable and follow up

Management is the art of consistently getting other people to do that which needs to be done - for the company, for the cause, for me. The job of a manager is to assign tasks to individual contributors and follow up to make sure they are completed properly and on time.

This lesson has been taught to me a hundred times, and still I have a hard time making it reality. Oftentimes in the real world people are too busy, under-resourced, not skilled enough, lack the appropriate [[128.011 Management - Task Relevant Maturity|task relevant maturity]], irresponsible, manipulative, distracted with personal issues, and on-and-on. That's just life and business! And for all these reasons, it is my job to track what my people have committed to, when they will have it done, and follow up appropriately to make sure it is completed.
