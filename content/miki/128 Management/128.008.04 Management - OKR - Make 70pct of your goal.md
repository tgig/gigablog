# Make 70% of your goal

OKRs are not designed to be 100% achieved within the period. They are designed to make the team stretch...

In fact, it's better to not hit your OKR than it is to exceed it by a large measure because it's clear that you were sandbagging when you made the goal.

The sweet spot is making about 70-80% of your OKR goals.
