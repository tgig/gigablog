# Google made OKRs famous

John Doerr brought OKRs to Google within a year of launch. He made a presentation to the founders and showed them how to use OKRs to set ambitious goals, measure them, and motivate people. Clearly, it worked, and now everybody in Silicon Valley (it seems) uses OKRs.

It is ambition, it embodies the ability to take risks.
