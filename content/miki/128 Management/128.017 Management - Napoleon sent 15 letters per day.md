# Napoleon sent 15 letters per day

**His wildly prodigious communications were designed to maximize his output.**

He dictated everything to his many aide-de-camps whose job it was to take notes and write the letter. The only letters he wrote himself are to lovers.

He would often dictate multiple letters to multiple aide-de-camps at the same time. Each would have to wait until he turned toward them to continue the letter.

**The aide-de-camps were trusted advisers and "eyes"** who received Napoleon's dictated letters and thoughts, and often his delegated authority.
