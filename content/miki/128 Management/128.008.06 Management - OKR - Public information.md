# OKRs are company-wide, public knowledge

OKRs are public knowledge, shared with the entire company. At any point in time anybody in the company should be able to see what the OKRs are for anybody else. And not just the current quarter's OKRs either, it's this quarter, last quarter (every quarter) AND the grades they got.
