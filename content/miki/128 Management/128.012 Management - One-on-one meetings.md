# One-on-one meetings

One-on-one meetings with everybody in the org are important for several reasons. Andy Grove writes _"Ninety minutes of your time can enhance the quality of your subordinate’s work for two weeks, or for some eighty-plus hours."_ 

A one-on-one can:
- help catch and fix problems when they’re small
- coach and develop people
- gain valuable insights from sharing information up and down the org
