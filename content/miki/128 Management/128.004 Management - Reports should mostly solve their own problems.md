# Reports should mostly solve their own problems

Most of the time as a manager, I want the people who I manage to solve the everyday problems themselves. Only the top 10% of hardest problems should surface to me, particularly questions about allocation of resources and strategic direction. If I can't trust my reports to solve problems then they are not appropriate for the position. Just make sure that it is "management" and not "abdication" (nod to Andy Grove).
