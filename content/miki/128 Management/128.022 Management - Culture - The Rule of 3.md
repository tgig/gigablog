# Culture: The Rule of 3

The Rule of 3 has been important in my professional life.

A founding team of 3 is completely different in communication, execution, and culture than a small company of 10, which is completely different than a company with 30, different than 100, 300, and 1,000.

Each company size requires a different culture, management approach and executive skill set. The company can be killed by not recognizing this.
