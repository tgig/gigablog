# Regular communication and reporting are important

To all of employees and investors and advisors and customers.

It doesn't need to be long and deep. It needs to be frequent and appropriate.

Slack and daily update/standups are great for the team. A private blog/distribution would be good for shareholders.

A weekly auto-email report is a great idea. Transparency and frequency.
