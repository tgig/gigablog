# Some rules for your focus sessions

There are a few rules that will make your working sessions much more effective. Follow these or risk accomplishing very little!

1. No internet, at all costs. Don't check email, don't look something up.
2. Phone on "do not disturb". 
3. Put the proper [[109.26 Productivity - Social rules for working from home]] in place with the family/colleagues

Without these simple environmental rules, your brain _always_ wants to switch to something easier, check email, check the news, etc. It will ruin any productivity, any hope for accomplishing something valuable.
