# Productivity

All of my professional life has been an exercise in attempting to increase productivity. Three or four hours per day of focused, uninterrupted work, is enough to produce enough valuable output to be satisfied with.

I have gone to great lengths to try and be more productive, but this world makes it hard - there is just too much to do, too much to be curious about, too many people to hang out with... and far too little time.

Which means that I have to make choices on what to spend my time on, and spend that time as wisely as possible.
