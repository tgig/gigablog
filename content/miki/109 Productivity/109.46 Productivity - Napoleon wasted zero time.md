# Napoleon wasted zero time

**Napoleon wasted zero time, and he focused maniacally on what was in his control**. He wasn't _all_ work, he spent plenty of time with Josephine and his mistresses, he hunted for exercise, he played cards with colleagues. But even at these things he was focusing on what was under his control and doing it with utter abandon and focus.
