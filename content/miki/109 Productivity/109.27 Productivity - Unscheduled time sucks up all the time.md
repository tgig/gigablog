# Unscheduled time sucks up all the time

If you don't schedule your time, you will spend it wandering aimlessly around, probably not accomplishing anything that you wanted to.

When I allocate a specific amount of time for a task, or when I have a deadline that must be met, the task has a tendency to get done. When I just start working on something it will possibly get done, but more likely I will procrastinate, get side tracked, expand the scope, etc. In other words, to get things done, **schedule time to work on it and set a deadline.**
