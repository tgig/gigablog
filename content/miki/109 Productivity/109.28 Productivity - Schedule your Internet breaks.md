# Schedule your Internet breaks

When scheduling calendar items, add specific blocks for checking the Internet. DO NOT LOOK AT ANYTHING CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET during sessions that aren't dedicated to it. If you run across a need to look something up on the net, write yourself a note to do it later.
