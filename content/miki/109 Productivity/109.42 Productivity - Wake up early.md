# Wake up early

Sleeping in is a great way to kill the day.

First, it starts the day off on a lazy note, which is hard to recover from.

Second, it starts the day off working on _other people's_ things (kids, bosses, meetings, etc)

Third, less overall time to get things done.

If being productive is important to you. Wake your ass up early. [[107.019 Philosophy - Jocko - Get your ass out of bed]]
