# Review your time spent and improve it the following week

Keep yourself accountable for your time spent.

As part of the Monday scheduling session, make yourself accountable to the previous week - what worked, where did you waste time, how can you adjust the schedule this week to do better?

Be sure to build this knowledge into the coming week's schedule so you can try to do better.
