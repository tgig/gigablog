# I lose time to personal things during the day

Even with the best of intentions. Even with every minute scheduled. I will often work on something like automobile maintenance, figuring out medical bills, doing random communication, etc. It feels like accomplishing something productive - and often these things need to get done anyway - but they should be scheduled and worked on in their own time.
