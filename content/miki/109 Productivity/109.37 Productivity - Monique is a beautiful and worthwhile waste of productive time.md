# Monique is a beautiful and worthwhile waste of productive time

I have been tracking my time very closely for over a month. My best week of work was when Monique was out of town. She is a distraction to my work, but it's a trade-off I make easily because I enjoy being with her. If I want to focus on getting things done, I need to be gone during the day, or make it very clear to her when I'm focused on work.
