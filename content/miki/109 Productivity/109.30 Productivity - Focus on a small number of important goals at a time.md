# Focus on a small number of important goals at a time

Focus on a small number of very important goals and try not to get distracted with anything else. The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish. 

If you feel the need to work on (or think about) something other than your most important goals, take the time necessary to understand if this is more important and why.
