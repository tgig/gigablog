# Always shut down email when not actively using it

**Always shut down your email when you're not actively reading/responding to it.** Email is an insidious time and attention sucker. It prevents any real work from getting done because you're always switching over briefly to see if anything came in - which is a break in concentration to start with - and on the many occasions where something does come in, then it's game over for whatever you were attempting to accomplish before.
