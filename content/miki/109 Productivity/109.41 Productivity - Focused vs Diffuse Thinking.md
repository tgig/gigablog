# Focused vs diffused thinking

* Use **focused thinking** when trying to create a new chunk or accomplish something specific. Focused thinking is directed attention on a single topic.
* Use **diffused thinking** when trying to be creative or solve a problem. Diffused thinking is rolling chunks of info around, meditation, Dali/Edison sleep training, walking, being open, not directly thinking about the topic.
* If you don't know anything about a topic yet, use focused thinking to learn new chunks of the first principles.  

I will always remember the Salvador Dali and Edison bit about drifting off to sleep and waking up to a loud crashing sound when the think you're holding onto falls out of your hand. I have tried it, and it works!
