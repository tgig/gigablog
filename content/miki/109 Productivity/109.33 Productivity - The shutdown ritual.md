# The shutdown ritual

The shutdown ritual at the end of the day can be an important way to transition from "work mode" to "family time". 

1. Ensure every incomplete task, goal, project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that there is plan in place or it is captured in a place where it will be revisited.
2. Take a final look at the email inbox to ensure there is nothing requiring an urgent response.
3. Transfer new tasks that are on your mind, or written down earlier in the day, to the official task list.
4. Skim every task in every list and make sure there is nothing urgent.
5. Look at the next few days of calendar and make sure nothing sneaks up on you tomorrow
6. Make a rough plan for the next day
7. Say out loud "Shutdown complete". Be done.
