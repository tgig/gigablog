# Measure progress toward goals

Have a way to measure the success of your most important goals. Otherwise, how will you know if you've achieved what you set out to do? How could you know if something else is now more important?

It's not always necessary to track the progress over time, but it is necessary to know how you're making progress and if you've achieved the goal.

Usually the most important indicator of progress is simply focused time spent on something. How many hours do you want to put in?

Sometimes the goal is clear, like "Complete the Statistics and Probability course on Coursera".

Sometimes you'll need to think a little harder about how to measure your progress, and consider if something that can't be measured is important enough to have on the list.
