# Prioritize and focus on one thing at a time

There is always too much to do!

We are always moving too slow!

We never get enough done to keep up!

This, by now, is a familiar feeling. Don't get overwhelmed, and don't feel anxious - this is the way of the world and especially for a small startup tech team.

Just prioritize what is most important and focus on it. Don't get distracted by a billion things, make space and time to get the most important thing done today. Then do the same thing tomorrow. Before you know it, significant progress has been made.
