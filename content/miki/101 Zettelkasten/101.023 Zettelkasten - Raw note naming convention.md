# Raw note naming convention

When I create a new raw note in the [[101.008 Zettelkasten - UNPROCESSED folder]] it has a specific naming convention in the style of:

```
YYYYMMDDHHmm Descriptive name
```
- `YYYY` = 4-digit year
- `MM` = 2-digit month
- `DD` = 2-digit day
- `HH` = 2-digit hour
- `mm` = 2-digit minute
- `Descriptive name` = name of the note, be verbose

This naming convention allows me to sort files, keep the date handy, easily know what the file is about, and use multiple styles of keyword searches to find it again.

Note: This is _only_ for the raw notes. Miki notes have a completely different [[101.015 Zettelkasten - ZK naming convention]].
