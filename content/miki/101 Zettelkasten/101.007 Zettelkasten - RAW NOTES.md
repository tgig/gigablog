# Raw Notes

Raw notes are the most common type of note in this system. They are taken all the time every day, every time I read an article or book, watch a video, or a new idea pops into my brain. 

They are the first step of nearly every ZK note.

No all Raw Notes end up in the ZK. Most of the time they are only for me, and I only move to the next step if there is some piece of information in the Raw Note that I want to save or add to the existing knowledge repository.
