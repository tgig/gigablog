# Just get started writing

Just get started writing. Worry about quality later, and likely never.
> If there is one piece of advice that is worth giving, it is to keep in mind that the first draft is only the first draft. Slavoj Žižek said in an interview that he wouldn’t be able to write a single sentence if he didn’t start by convincing himself he was only writing down some ideas for himself, and that maybe he could turn it into something publishable later. By the time he stopped writing, he was always surprised to find that the only thing left to do was revise the draft he already had. P145

By writing from the ZK, I already have content. I already had the inspiration to research and write something down. Now I just need to get started writing.
