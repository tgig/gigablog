# My ZK naming convention

## The old way

I switched away from this method in place of something more flexible and creative.
[[101.016 Zettelkasten - The OLD zettel naming convention]]

## The new way (as of 20200824)

1. Each top level category gets a number. E.g. "101 Zettelkasten".
2. Each zettel in the general category gets an ascending ID. E.g. 101.001, 101.002

This naming convention still assigns a unique ID to every file in the Miki, but does not force me to categorize as much, allowing the notes to flow more easily. I now rely on interlinking of files to provide structure instead of the rigid naming convention.
