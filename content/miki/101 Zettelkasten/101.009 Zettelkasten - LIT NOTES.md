# LIT NOTES

Lit notes are the second step of the [[101.006 Zettelkasten - ZK workflow]].

We take the [[101.007 Zettelkasten - RAW NOTES]] and distill them into more consumable chunks of content. 

Usually the middle step between the RAW NOTE and a PERMANENT NOTE, but could be taken directly from an article or video is there is no need to do the long form rambling note first.

## Lit note rules

- LIT NOTES should have a reference block at the top with link back to the RAW NOTES, and the same author/source links.
- LIT NOTES should be brief and in your own words.
