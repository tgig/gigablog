# UNPROCESSED Folder

- The UNPROCESSED folder is where my new, raw, topic-by-topic notes are created and filled up. 
- Notes will remain in this folder until I review them, decide if anything needs to be permanently moved into the ZK folder. Workflow:
	- Create a new note in the UNPROCESSED folder by using the keystroke COMMAND+T, which will create a note in the format "YYYYMMDDHHMM Today"
	- Modify the title of the note to reflect the current topic
	- Take notes
	- Feel free to take a day or two before the next step
	- Review the note content and distill content into a [[101.009 Zettelkasten - LIT NOTES]]. If anything needs to be [[101.010 Zettelkasten - PERMANENT NOTES]] moved to the ZK folder, do it.
	- Move to the PROCESSED folder
