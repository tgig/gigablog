# BTYD Models

## History

Buy Till You Die (BTYD) is originally implemented in the insurance industry where customers will literally continue buying the product until they die. They are best for situations where there is a subscription or other contractual setting, not wonderful for retail prediction (1).

BTYD models are based on [[108.30.10.20.20.10 Data Analysis - Segments - RFM]]
- Recency (R)
- Frequency (F)
- Number of people for each combination of R/F - the raw data needs to be aggregated into the groupings of R/F groups)

## Models

Models in the BTYD family are:
- [[113.020.050.10 BTYD - BGBB]]
- [[113.020.050.20 BTYD - BG NBD]]
- [[113.020.050.30 BTYD - Pareto NBD]]

## Code

There are multiple libraries that implement the BTYD models. This is just one of them
