# How to read math notation

There are some things I never learned (or forgot) about math, starting very simple, like how to read notation.

---

## `P(H)`

```
P = probability
H = hypothesis
P(H) = probability that the hypothesis is true
```

In the case of Bayes Theorem (and maybe others?), `P(H)` is called the "Prior"

```
E = evidence
P(H|E) = probability that the hypothesis is true GIVEN THAT the evidence is true
```
- Probability of getting a result from `POP(1)` given the relative size and percent of `POP(1)` vs `POP(2)`
- The vertical bar says "GIVEN THAT". It LIMITS the view
- Also called the LIKELIHOOD

---

## $$\propto$$

Something like this:

$$P(\theta | \Upsilon) \propto P(\Upsilon | \theta)P(\theta)$$

Reads like:
- Probability of theta given upsilon **is proportional to** the probability of upsilon given theta times the probability of theta.

Intersect symbol
- $$\cap$$
- $$X \cap Y$$
	- Reads: All the things that are in set X _and_ also in set Y


Sigma
$$\sigma$$

Variance. This is the symbol for variance:
$$\sigma^2$$

"Sample mean"
$$\bar{x}$$
- "x with a bar over it"

"Sample variance"
$$s^2_{n-1}$$
- In math notation
	- $$\frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2 }{n-1}$$
- Using "n" minus 1 is a better estimate than using "n"

The "hat" latex symbol is 
- $$\hat{y}$$
- Used to indicate a regression line

"M" or mu (myu) designates a population mean
$$\mu$$
- This population mean can be used in a subsequent mathematical formula


Union symbol
- $$\cup$$
- $$X \cup Y$$
	- Reads: All the elements that are in set X _or_ in set Y

Set minus
- $$A \setminus B$$
	- Reads: All the things that are in set A that are not in set B

Complement
- If `U` = the universe, `A` = a set within the universe, then
- `A'` is everything in the `U` that is not in `A`, or the complement of `A`, or
	- $$A' = U - A$$
	- $$A' = U \setminus A$$


The universal set of Integers math notation
- $$\mathbb{Z}$$
- Other "blackboard bold" notation
	- Real numbers = $$\mathbb{R}$$
	- Rational numbers = $$\mathbb{Q}$$

Membership math notation
- $$-5 \in \mathbb{Z}$$
	- Reads: negative five is in the set of integers
- $$X \notin \mathbb{Z}$$
	- Reads: the letter X is not in the set of integers

Subset/superset math notation
- Given two sets:
	- `A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 18}`
	- `B = {1, 7, 18}`
- Then:
	- Subset: every element of set `B` is also in set `A`: $$B \subseteq A$$
	- Superset: Set `A` contains every element of set `B`: $$A \supseteq B$$

"Given" symbol
- `P(A | B)` the `|` pipe means "given"
- You would read this as the probability of A _given_ that B has already happened


Notation similarities
- $$E(X) = \mu_X$$
	- The expected value of a random variable X equals the mean of X
- $$Var(X) = E((X - \mu_X)^2) = \sigma_X^2$$
	- The variability of random variable X is equal to the expected value of the squared differences between our random variable X and its mean, which is also sigma squared for the random variable X
