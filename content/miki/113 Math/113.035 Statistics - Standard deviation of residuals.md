# Standard deviation of residuals

Very similar to standard deviation of a series
- $$S_r = \sqrt{\frac{(r_1)^2 + (r_2)^2 + ... + (r_n)^2}{(n - 1)}}$$
	- Take the residual of each point on the scatterplot (against the regression line), square it, divide by (1-n), and square root the whole thing
- Then, you can take that standard deviation and draw a line on each side of the regression line to show values that are within 1 Standard Deviation of the regression line
