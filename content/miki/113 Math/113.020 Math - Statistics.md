# Statistics

Statistics is funky, and there is a lot of it. I'm not sure I'll do any justice to an organization of this topic, but here goes nothing.

# Types of statistics
## Data analysis
[[108 Data Analysis]] is an associated topic to Statistics. 

## Descriptive statistics
Descriptive statistics is self-describing :) Most of [[108.30.10 Data Analysis - Structural analysis]] is "descriptive" because we have all the data and we're simply trying to format and visualize it to summarize the data and learn things which may not be easily apparent.

## Inferential statistics
Inferential stats is when you need to infer knowledge from a data set that is not complete. E.g. Prediction of future data based on the currently available data, or probability of distribution of future values.
