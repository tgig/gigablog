# Difference between Expo vs Weibull vs Cox

These notes reference the equations from [[113.020.010.10.20 Regression models - Exponential Distribution]], especially the last two with b-naught.

### Exponential
- b-naught is a constant - it is a number
- It doesn't change, there is no time in the function, so it doesn't change over time
    - Constant hazard
	    - This is the same as PH, but not named after it

### Weibull
- b-naught increases/decreases _proportionally_ with time
- b-naught is `ln(\alpha) * ln(t) + b-naught`
    - So you can see that as time gets bigger, the b-naught gets proportionally bigger

### Cox
- b-naught can fluctuate, it can increase/decrease with time, multiple times
- b-naught is `ln(h-naught(t))`
- Can estimate all the coefficients in the model w/o having to specify the function
- This function is good for effect-size models, doesn't work for predictive models where you want to predict/estimate survival
