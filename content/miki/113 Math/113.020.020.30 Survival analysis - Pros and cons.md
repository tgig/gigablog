# Survival Analysis - Pros and Cons

## Bottom-line:
- Kaplan-Meier is simple, but overly simple and doesn't work well for estimation b/c it is non-parametric and you can't easily estimate numbers that in-between times.
- Weibull is an exponential model which has a hazard that can increase proportionally as time (t) progresses, which is not always realistic
- Proportional Hazards is most accurate b/c the Hazard can fluctuate as Time goes on, but it's also the most complicated and you can't estimate the survival function.

# Models

## Kaplan Meier
- Pros
    - Simple
    - You can estimate the survival
- Cons
    - No functional form - no simple mathematical function that describes it
    - Can not estimate the hazard ratio
    - Can only include a _few_ categorical `x`'s

## Exponential
- Pros
    - Can estimate `S(t)` and HR
- Cons
    - Not always realistic
        - Weibull (parametric) allows HAZ to increase/decrease proportionally with time, but this isn't realistic all the time either
		- Assumes a constant hazard, which is bad. E.g. 
            - as humans our risk of dying increases as we get older
            - as babies we have a low risk, then higher risk as teens (risky behavior), then lower again at 30-40, then higher again as we go >60-70

## Cox Proportional Hazard 
- [[113.020.020.50 Survival Analysis - Proportional Hazards PH]]
- Pros
    - Hazard can fluctuate with time, can increase/decrease as time goes by
    - Can estimate the hazard ratio
- Cons
    - Can not estimate the survival function `S(t)`
