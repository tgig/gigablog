# General multiplication rule

- `P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B | A) = P(B) * P(A | B)`
- We can multiply the two events but we need to take the first event into account when considering the probability of the second event
- Note: `P(A|B) != P(B|A)`, but if you multiply by the conditional probability they are equal
