# Poisson distribution

### Poisson Process
- Events that occur independently over time
    - Rate = lambda = y/t 
        - number of occurrences over time

### Poisson Distribution
- Let y = number of occurrences in time t
- Fixes the "time" and says "given the amount of time, how often does the event occur"
