# Cumulative Distribution Function

The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) tells you the percent of area that is less than a given point on a normal distribution area.
- To get the percent likelihood of something falling between, say, -1 and 1, you would first run `CDF(-1)` and subtract that from `CDF(1)` to get the probability.
