# Empirical Rule

- Also known as the 68/95/99.7 rule
- Very similar to Pareto
- In a normal distribution, if you go 1 standard deviation from the mean, it will be a 68% chance of falling within that area. 
- If you go two standard deviations you have a 95% chance
- Three standard deviations is 99.7% chance
