# Logarithms

At it's most simple, a logarithm is just something that, given a power of ten, spits out the number of zeros at the end of it.

- `log(1) = 0`
- `log(10) = 1`
- `log(100) = 2`
- `log(1,000) = 3`
- `log(10,000) = 4`

Most of the time when you see `log()` it is referring to log base 10.
$$log_{10}()$$

There is a convention in math where often `log()` is referring to `log_e() = ln()` (but I need to learn more about this)
$$log_e()$$

`log(a * b) = log(a) + log(b)`
- Intuitive because you're just counting the number of zeros like this:
	- $$(log(1,000) + log(100)) = log(1,000 \times 100) = log(100,000) = 5$$

The earthquake scale is `log_32`. An 8.0 seismic earthquake is 32X larger than a 7.0 earthquake (which is, of course, 32X larger than a 6.0).

Decibels are a logarithmic scale.
