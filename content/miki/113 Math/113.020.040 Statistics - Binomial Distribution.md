![[113.020.040-20200812-Math-binomial-distribution.png]]

A binomial distribution is a way to get confidence in aggregate data. It is a way to tell the probability of a result happening as compared to all the other possible results.

$$P(data|success rate)$$
- Reads: probability of data being true given the success rate

$$P(48(1), 2(0) | s = 0.95))$$
or
$${50 \choose 48}{(0.95)^{48}}{(1 - 0.95)^2}$$
- Reads: 50 choose 48 and represents the number of ways you could arrange 50 slots w/ only 2 of them different than the others.

`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaBB`
or
`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaBaB`
...and a bunch of other ways
