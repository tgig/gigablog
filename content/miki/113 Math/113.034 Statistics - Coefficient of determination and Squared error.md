# Coefficient of determination and Squared error

`r^2` = **coefficient of determination**
- Always between zero and one: `0 >= r^2 <= 1`
- `r^2` is literally just `r` squared, it's that easy
- $$r^2 = 1 - \frac{SE_{regression}}{SE_\bar{y}}$$
- Reads: r squared = 1 minus the squared error of the regression line divided by the squared error of the average of all y values
- If **squared error** is small, it means that the residuals of all points along the regression line are small and they fit the line pretty well
- If **squared error** is big, it means that the residuals of the points along the regression line are big and they don't fit the line very well
- So, `r^2` close to 1 is a good fit and `r^2` close to zero is a bad fit
