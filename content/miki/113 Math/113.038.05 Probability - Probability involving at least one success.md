# Probability involving "at least one success"

- Get the probability of "all successes" then subtract that from 1
- E.g. Lebron is a 75% free throw shooter. What's the likelihood that he misses at least 1 out of 3 free throws?
	- Probability of all successes = `.75^3` = .422
	- Probability of at least one miss = `1 - (.75^3)` = .578
