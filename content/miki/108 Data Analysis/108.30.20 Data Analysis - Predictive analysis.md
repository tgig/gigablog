# Predictive analysis

## Overview
Predictive analysis is using historical numbers to make predictions about future numbers. It is finding patterns in historical information to create a model of the data and persist those patterns into the future. (1)

Prediction models are meant to forecast individual drivers. E.g. we're able to forecast revenue by segment, we backtest revenue

## Predictive analysis best practices

## Model classes

### Projecting growth/death
- [[113.020.020.50 Survival Analysis - Proportional Hazards PH]] - how many customers will this company acquire in future periods? (models the leading edge of the cohort triangle)
    - Proportional Hazards is in the [[113.020.020 Statistics - Survival Analysis]] family

### Projecting repeat/churn
Based on customers already acquired, how many of them will churn? (repeat purchase)
  - SBG (Shifted beta geometric) - for subscription
  - [[113.020.050 Statistics - BTYD models]] (Buy till you die) models BG/BB, BG/NBD, Pareto/NBD
  - Customer-based valuation for non-contractual firms: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3040422

### Projecting spend
gamma gamma (not used as of time I arrived at TS), time series

### Other approaches
Other approaches to predictive analytics include
- CART
- MARS
- Neural networks
