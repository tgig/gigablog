# Make decisions

Managers need to make many hard decisions. It helps when they have some data to back up the decision-making process.

This class of problem generally requires [[108.30.30 Data Analysis - Prescriptive analysis]]
Here are some of the kinds of decisions they can use data science to help with:

- Impact of packaging, upsells, new products
	- Would bundling services increase overall revenue?
	- Would launching a mobile app impact usage on the web site?
	- RFM segmentation, and reaching out to best customer groups can be useful here [[108.30.10.20.20.10 Data Analysis - Segments - RFM]]
- Impact of promotions
	- Are customers who use coupons borrowing from future purchases?
	- Will sale buyers become loyal purchasers?
- Impact of displays
	- Which type of displays (e.g. End of aisle) work better? 
- Within and across category
	- Which categories are substitutes / complements?

Note, these are slightly different than the case of [[108.20.10 Data Analysis - Optimize]].
