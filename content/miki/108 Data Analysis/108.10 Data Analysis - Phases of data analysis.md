# Phases of data analysis

There are different opinions on the distinct phases of data analysis. Sources like [[20200622 Wharton Customer Analytics]] and [[20200623 Coursera John Hopkins Data Science]] have slightly different opinions. As such, these are not "rules" just suggestions.

My own experience is based on, but slightly different than, Wharton and John Hopkins, largely based on prior experience at Lucky8 [[20200706 Lucky8 notes (clustered)]]. This page is organized from my own experiences, with strong doses of academia influence.
