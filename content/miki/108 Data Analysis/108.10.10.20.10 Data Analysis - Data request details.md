# Data request details

The data request is a document which outlines the data we need to complete our analysis.

- Transaction date and client id are the most important columns.
- If you're not clear up front about what format the data should come in, often times it comes in the wrong way, too late and you're screwed
- Send the data request with a data format example attached. It can be an excel document or csv with sample data in the proper format
- If we're talking about Big Data, request a sample data set to start with, something that can be easily pulled and sent to us to make sure everybody is on the same page about what data is being requested and that it's in the proper format before they take the time to do the big pull of everything.
