# Output generator

It would be good to have a way to toggle the different kinds of outputs that would be sent to the output visualization tool. Every company is going to be a little bit different than the last, but with a process, standardization happens over the course of many projects.

At Lucky8 we would either take screenshots of stuff in Excel/Tableau and paste that into a powerpoint. Or we would use connected google docs (but the graphs are crap). 
- I don't have the right answer here yet, but it would be great to have a high quality output platform.
	- This looks interesting! https://flourish.studio/examples/
		- I actually _love_ the scrollytelling example, fits nicely with "epic"

We never had this at Lucky8 because [[108.40.10.20 Data Analysis - Excel is amazing and it sucks too]]. It would be extremely difficult to remove Excel from the workflow completely.
