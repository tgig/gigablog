# RFM - How to segment RFM

### Step 1

To implement this model you must have RFM information on each individual customer like this:

```
customer_id		recency_days	frequency_times		monetary_clv
1				3				6					540
2				6				10					940
3				45				1					30
4				21				2					64
5				14				4					169
```

### Step 2

Then, for each of R/F/M sort the list in order by score and give each `customer_id` a score from 1-5. 

> Data note: In this example there are only 5 records, so each `customer_id` gets a unique score, but in most cases you will divide the groups evenly. E.g. if there are 100 customers, there will be 20 of them with each score.

**R** (ascending order)
```
customer_id		r_value		r_score
1				3			5
2				6			4
5				14			3
4				21			2
3				45			1
```

**F** (descending order)
```
customer_id		f_value		f_score
2				10			5
1				6			4
5				4			3
4				2			2
3				1			1
```

**M** (descending order)
```
customer_id		m_value		m_score
2				940			5
1				540			4
5				169			3
4				64			2
3				30			1
```

### Step 3

Put `r_score` on the x-axis. Put `AVG(f_score + m_score)` on y-axis.

> In most cases, it seems that R & F are used to segment customers. In this case, as in the reference (1) I'm averaging `(F+M)/2` because frequency and monetary value are closely related.

```
customer_id		x_value		y_value
[1]				5			4
[2]				4			5
[3]				1			1
[4]				2			2
[5]				3			3
