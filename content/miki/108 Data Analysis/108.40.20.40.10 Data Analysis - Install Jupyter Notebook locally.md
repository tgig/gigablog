# Install Jupyter notebook locally

Jupyter is a great tool for working through problems in python. To install it locally, do this:

Steps
1. Install a virtualenv: [[121.001 Python - Python virtualenv]]
2. Install: `pip install notebook`
3. Run: `jupyter notebook`
	- This is a long running process, make sure to run it in a command line you don't need to use for other things
