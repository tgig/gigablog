# Client working relationship

It is almost immeasurably helpful to have a relationship with the client's CTO, their engineers, business people. It's huge. Meeting a competent data and business team, and having a relationship with them was a huge help for some engagements, and a massive roadblock for others.

There is often one person who is in charge of giving you the data and another person who knows how to interpret that data. E.g. "We're giving you the data, Mitesh needs to tell you how to interpret the data."
