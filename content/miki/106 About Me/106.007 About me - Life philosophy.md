# Life philosophy

I am on a journey of learning, curiosity, and connection. I strive to be, to LIVE, these philosophies. These are the mindsets I use in a lifelong quest to fulfill [[106.005 About me - My life mission|my mission]].

One important lesson from Stoic philosophy, as in most religions, is to emulate the [[https://dailystoic.com/always-keep-a-role-model-in-mind/|role models]] you want to be like. In the spirit of this mindset, others have inspired me, and framed my beliefs much more eloquently than I could, as I strive to embody these ideas:

## BE A WORLD-CLASS COMMUNICATOR

**I was born (or raised?) without the capacity for empathy, but I can grow a sequoia of it by focusing on it every day.**

_"I never, never, never hear what somebody thinks about me. Never hear what somebody thinks about you, you'll live longer. You'll enjoy life more. Hear the truth. The truth is that when somebody's telling you what's wrong with you, the truth is they have a need that isn't getting met. Hear that they're in pain. Don't hear the analysis."_ - Marshall B. Rosenberg

_"You discover that commitment is not something you declare on one bright, over - planned day but something you perform every hour for a lifetime. You realize that trust is not a noun that describes a state; it is a verb that indicates action. You demonstrate tolerance, listen with your third ear, and cultivate understanding. You learn to agree to disagree."_ - Keith Wilson, [[119 Constructive Conflict|Constructive Conflict]]

## EVERY DAY IS AN OPPORTUNITY to accomplish something. 

**I can do something today to make my self, business, family, better.**
  
_"At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: ‘I have to go to work—as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for—the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?"_ - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 
[[107.018 Philosophy - Stoicism - Time to get to work]]
  
_"The test is not a complex one: when the alarm goes off, do you get up out of bed, or do you lie there in comfort and fall back to sleep? If you have the discipline to get out of bed, you win—you pass the test. If you are mentally weak for that moment and you let that weakness keep you in bed, you fail. Though it seems small, that weakness translates to more significant decisions. But if you exercise discipline, that too translates to more substantial elements of your life."_ - Jocko Willink in Extreme Ownership

## BE OPEN-MINDED, YET CONFIDENT. 

**I am an idiot with a huge ego, and I don't want to stay blind for the rest of my life.**  
  
I want an open, learning, mindset. I want my first reaction always to be to learn something about myself and about the world. In the past, I have often been "smart" enough and proud enough to think I can do everything right and get frustrated when others didn't think that was the case. When I decide to do it anyway, I'm usually too blind to see when I fail.  
  
Now I'm old enough, and know myself well enough, to know that I can't do everything, but I can learn from others who know better than me. There is a fine line here - I need to have confidence, I need to make a judgment on whether the other person is "believable" enough to listen to, I need to be wise enough to know when to listen and learn and when to believe in myself. 

Ray on one shoulder, Drake on the other:
  
_"If you know that you are blind, you can figure out a way to see, whereas if you don't know that you're blind, you will continue to bump into your problems. In other words, if you can recognize that you have blind spots and open-mindedly consider the possibility that others might see something better than you - and that the threats and opportunities they are trying to point out really exist - you are more likely to make good decisions. Radical open-mindedness is motivated by the genuine worry that you might not be seeing your choices optimally. It is the ability to effectively explore different points of view and different possibilities without letting your ego or your blind spots get in your way. it requires you to replace your attachment to always being right with the joy of learning what's true."_ - Ray Dalio, Principles, 3.2
[[107.020 Philosophy - Dalio - Open mindedness]]
  
Balanced with:  
_"God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself? Cause myself just told myself 'You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help'"_ - Drake  
  
This open-yet-confident mindset will help me overcome personal limitations that have caused me failure in the past. It will help me become more successful in my personal life and my business dealings. It will not be easy, because I am proud, stubborn, smart, set in my ways.

## DON'T TRY TO DO EVERYTHING YOURSELF. 

**Outsource the things I'm not so good at, don't want to do, don't have time to do.**  
  
I am often guilty of trying to do everything just because I can. I pay the price in several ways. I sacrifice something else I could (and should) have been doing. I don't do as good of a job as somebody who is better than me. I don't enjoy the task very much.  
  
I need to be better at asking people to do things for me.  
  
_"Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that you should develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what you shouldn't be doing."_ -- Ray Dalio

## KEEP IT SIMPLE

**It is hard but important to make something simple. Especially when that thing is difficult and complex.**

I am constantly getting overwhelmed by "too much". I commit to too many things, am curious about too many things, expect too much, want too much. It's _HARD_ to be simple when the world is so abundant and life is so short...

_"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"_ - Leonardo da Vinci

_"In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness"_ - Yvon Chouinard - founder of Patagonia

_"I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter"_ - Blaise Pascal
