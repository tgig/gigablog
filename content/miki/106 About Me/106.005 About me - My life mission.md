# My life mission

As written in 2007

_"To consciously seek freedom of choice, wisdom, healthy relationships, new experiences, and challenges; to be honest and reliable; and to leave this world in peace."_

This statement reflects my desire for financial and personal freedom. 
It reflects my continual journey for knowledge and the best ways to apply that knowledge. 
It acknowledges my family and friends and my desire to stay close to them, striving to be a master communicator. 
It reveals that I'm addicted to travel and learning and doing new things. 
It gives a nod to my values of honesty and reliability, and the desire to keep a clean conscience in regards to decisions I make about all of the above.
