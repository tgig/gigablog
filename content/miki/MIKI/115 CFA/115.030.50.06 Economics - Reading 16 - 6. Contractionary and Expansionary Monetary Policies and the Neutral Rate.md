What is a "neutral rate of interest"? What is the math formula?
- A neutral rate of interest is a rate of interest that neither deliberately seeks to stimulate aggregate demand and growth nor deliberately seeks to weaken growth from its current level. In other words, a neutral rate of interest would be one that encourages a rate of growth of demand close to the estimated trend rate of growth of real GDP.
- `Neutral rate = Trend growth + Inflation target`

What is a demand shock?
A demand shock is a sudden surprise event that increases or decreases demand.

What is quantitative easing (QE)?
