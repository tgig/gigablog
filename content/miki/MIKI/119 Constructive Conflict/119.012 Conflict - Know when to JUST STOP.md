# Know when to JUST STOP

If you say something that is taken poorly by the other person, either misinterpreted, poorly phrased, not set up well, etc., and you see "that look" of anger, frustration, impatience, (you _know_ the look), JUST STOP. There is no need to belabor the point, it has been made already. If you want to continue the conversation, you need to make a repair in order to move on. The same principle applies if you notice that one partner is trying to end a fight.
