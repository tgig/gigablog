# Data request

The data request is sent to a client after a project contract has been signed. This is the outline for data we need to complete the analysis and answer the questions we should have already outlined while getting conceptual agreement [[105.40.30.20 Consulting - Get conceptual agreement before submitting proposal]].

Most of the time we will be conducting [[108.20 Data Analysis - Customer analysis]], so we need customer level detail - the actions and transactions at the level of an individual customer.

We will create and send a data request: [[108.10.10.20.10 Data Analysis - Data request details]]

We will communicate with somebody from the client tech team to facilitate the data transfer. The [[108.10.10.10 Data Analysis - Client working relationship]] is very important here, because we will rely on these people to be able to do our job.

Potential sample data review
	* Call with client to understand the data

Remember, however, that the _perfect data_ will never be coming. Often you just have to use what you have and do the best job you can. (1)
