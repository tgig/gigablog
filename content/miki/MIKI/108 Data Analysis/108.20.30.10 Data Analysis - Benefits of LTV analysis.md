# Benefits of LTV analysis

Knowing your customer LTV is important for several reasons.

Many of these items are similar to what is listed already on [[108.20.10 Data Analysis - Optimize]].

- Tell you what an individual customer is worth
- Allow you to estimate the value of your company's overall customer equity

Segmentation opportunities with LTV?
- Enable the company to divide customers into tangible segments (Related to [[108.30.10.20.20.10 Data Analysis - Segments - RFM]]), separating the most valuable and committed customers into different groups and distinguishing them from the less valuable but numerous others
- Create opportunities to help you refine marketing practices and ensure the right approaches are being made to the right customers
- Allow you to better predict how certain customers in certain situations might act going forward
- Ensure that resources are used more efficiently in efforts to retain and develop existing customers and acquire new ones

> !!!! What is the difference between segmentation using RFM and segmentation using LTV? For RFM it makes sense because it can be a 2D plot. For LTV it would only be a sliding scale, and newer customers who might be better won't have had enough time to build a high LTV
