# "the biggest cause of serious error in this business is a failure of communication" 

From the Checklist Manifesto, re. the construction biz - and also true for me. Always be sure the important players in a game know the next play and how to execute it.

However, keep in mind that the construction industry is a heavily checklist and routine dependent business. Everybody knows in advance what the next step is, so a failure to execute properly is a failure of communication.
