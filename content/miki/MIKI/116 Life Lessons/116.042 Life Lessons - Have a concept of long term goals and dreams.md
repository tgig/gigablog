# I want to always have a concept of my long term goals and dreams, and make more short term decisions based on that vision.

Write down my strategies - what is motivating me to do "this" vs "that"? What do you want to be / look like / feel like / be perceived like? Where do you want to live / vacation / invest your money / go to school / spend your time / make your mark? Who do you want to know / work with / work out with / vacation with / be friends with / ? Why?
