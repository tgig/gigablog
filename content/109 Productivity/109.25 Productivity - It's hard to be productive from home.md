# It's hard to be productive from home

It is hard to be effective when working from home, around wife and kids, because my time is not my own. They can step into my reality at any time. 

If you _must_ work from home, try to do it in an isolated place.

If you _must_ work from home, try to set social rules for when it's OK to be disturbed and when it is not.
