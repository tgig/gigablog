# Marginal Utility

"Utility" is a word for the amount of "value" that a person gets by having something. So, "marginal utility" is the amount of _extra value_ that a person gets by having one more (or less) of those things.

_"In economics, utility is the satisfaction or benefit derived by consuming a product; thus the marginal utility of a good or service is the change in the utility from an increase in the consumption of that good or service."_
