# Rational Decisions



Optimal decision making by rational agents involves the simple equation:
$$ Benefits - Costs $$
- Costs can be broken down into two different types:
	- **Explicit** - an explicit price associated with it
	- **Implicit** - e.g. Opportunity Cost (the cost of the next best alternative)

E.g. the cost of going to a movie is not just the _explicit_ cost of purchasing a movie ticket for $10. If you are giving up working at a $30/hr job for 3-hours, the _implicit_ cost is an extra $90. _Total cost_ of going to the movie is $100.
