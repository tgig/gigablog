What is behavioral finance?

What is the Loss Aversion theory?

What is the Overconfidence theory?
Most people consider themselves to be better than average in most things they do. For example, 80% of drivers contend that they are better than "average" drivers. Is that really possible? Studies show that money managers, advisors, and investors are consistently overconfident in their ability to outperform the market. Most fail to do so, however.

What is information cascading and herding?
