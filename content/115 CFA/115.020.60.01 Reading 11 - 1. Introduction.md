What are the seven steps of testing a hypothesis?
1. State the Null Hypothesis and the Alternate Hypothesis
2. Determine the Appropriate Test Statistic and its Probability Distribution
3. Select the Level of Significance
4. Formulate the Decision Rule
5. Collect the Data, Perform Calculations (calculate the test statistic)
6. Making a Decision
7. Making an Investment Decision
