# You can't objectively measure a test unless you set a prediction for it beforehand

## Preferred Option: 
[[127 Scientific Method]]

## Method 2:

If you set a S.M.A.R.T. goal, it is easy to gauge success/failure of a test or project.

If you don't set a goal, it is easy to justify the results and string along a project for years before you understand if it is working.

S = Specific
M = Measurable
A = Achievable
R = Relevant
T = Time-bound
