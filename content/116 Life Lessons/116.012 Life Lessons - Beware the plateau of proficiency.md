# Beware the plateau of proficiency

One thing I know about myself (and human nature in general) is that it is very easy to go into autopilot for anything I become proficient enough to accomplish reasonably well. If I find something that is important to be very good at, I need to get outside my comfort level in order to move past the plateau of proficiency. Engage a coach, mentor, partner, friend, etc., who can hold me accountable and help me improve to the next level.
