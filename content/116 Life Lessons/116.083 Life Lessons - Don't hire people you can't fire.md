# Don't hire people you can't fire

I had the hard choice of selling the company for less than it could have eventually been worth or firing friends/family to meet payroll.

I put people I loved in positions of responsibility and I couldn't remove them, couldn't overpower them, couldn't undermine them.

The people who I am closest to in the world… the consequence of getting it wrong is too great. Think real hard before doing it again…
